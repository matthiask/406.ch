# From PHP and SWISDK2 to Python and Django -- 12 years later

Once at a time[^oaat] there was an [agency](http://web.archive.org/web/20061001000000*/www.feinheit.ch) founded by a few friends and myself. We were using PHP at the time and had our own framework, the [SWISDK -- Simple Web Infrastructure SDK](https://github.com/matthiask/swisdk2/); quite a mouthful. It supported many features which are now commonplace in web frameworks such as an ORM, a mostly autogenerated admin interface, forms which could be used together with models, some sort of routing, generic views[^viewsets], XSS and CSRF protection, support for translations in the code and the database, images, galleries, comments etc.

[^oaat]: A bit more than 14 years ago. I can hardly believe it myself.
[^viewsets]: Or rather viewsets.

I think I had [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) on my radar for quite a while already. I liked the template language and especially the template inheritance feature so much that I reimplemented it as an extension to the [Smarty template engine](https://www.smarty.net/). Smarty has built-in support for template inheritance since 2009 but I didn't profit from this anymore, because we migrated to Python and Django in 2007/2008[^2007] and have never looked back. This was after manipulators had been replaced by the newforms library (the current `django.forms`) but before the newforms admin and before Django 1.0.

[^2007]: According to the Django ticket tracker I already hit [bugs](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7125) in April 2008 while working on my diploma thesis; the switch must have happened at the end of 2007/beginning of 2008 then.

I also took a long and hard look at [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) as an alternative. Ruby used and uses too much interpunction for my taste. Writing this down does not make it sound or feel better -- as a reason it still sounds as meaningless as ever.

The decisive push factors were:

- For me, PHP wasn't a fun language anymore. The inconsistencies were annoying at best (e.g. the order of needle and haystack in various function signatures).
- Maintaining an in-house framework was to expensive in terms of hours and energy. The maintenance and continued development occupied a significant portion of my time and I just couldn't continue taking the responsibility for this.

Pull factors for Python and Django were:

- I didn't get Django's manipulators a year earlier but I immediately saw that `django.forms` were more-or-less a drop-in replacement for what we had in SWISDK2. Of course, Django has grown and improved since and SWISDK2 has been ... dead.
- Django's administration interface (!!) -- it was and still is an awesome piece of engineering.

Python and Django, both the language and the community hasn't let me down and I hope the same is true vice versa. The excellent [DjangoCon EU 2020](https://2020.djangocon.eu/) has only helped making me ever more glad about that choice.

Here's to ten more years of Python and Django -- also at [Feinheit](https://feinheit.ch/).
