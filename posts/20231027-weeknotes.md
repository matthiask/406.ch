## Switching to ruff format

[ruff v0.1.2](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.1.2) includes
the beta version of the ruff formatter. It formats the code almost the same way
as black, but much much faster. I have started switching projects I'm working
on and the experience has been nothing but great.

## 100% test coverage

I have again fixed a bad bug in code which had 100% test coverage. It's not
news that 100% test coverage isn't a recipe for bug-free code, and it's
probably not even worth optimizing for that metric in code. It's nothing more
but a proxy for what you should really measure. Nevertheless it certainly does
feel good to achieve high coverage values!

## Releases

No releases at all.
