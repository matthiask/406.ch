Title: How I handle versioning
Categories:
Draft: remove-this-to-publish

Points

- 0.0.x (no changelog, everything breaks)
- 0.x.0 (minor updates, you *have* to test if it works)
- ?.?.x (bugfixes and pure additions)
- 1.0.0 (I'm happy to start using semver more properly)
- 1.0.x (again, bugfixes and feature additions)

Release quickly instead of waiting for more changes. Just put out releases all the time.
