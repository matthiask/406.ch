# Weeknotes (2021 week 11)

## django-simple-redirects

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s built-in `django.contrib.redirects` app has a hard dependency on `django.contrib.sites`. I'm a big fan of NOT hardcoding the current site into the database or into settings except where absolutely necessary. Because of this I extracted the parts I liked into a standalone package with a [questionable and needlessly derogatory name](https://pypi.org/project/django-sane-redirects/) a few years ago. The old package is still around (no need to break setups) but the package has been renamed to **django-simple-redirects**, cleaned up for current versions of Python and Django and also been uploaded to PyPI.

## CKEditor instances in Django's admin interface without IFRAMEs

Currently incubating in feincms3. I have a strong dislike for scrollables inside scrollables, the proposed interface is much better.

Of course I'm still thinking about reimplementing the whole editing interface using [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/), but oh well... maybe another time, when I do not have any projects for months to come.
