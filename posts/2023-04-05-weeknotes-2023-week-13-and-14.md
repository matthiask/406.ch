# Weeknotes (2023 week 13 and 14)

## My son will be a teenager soon

My eldest is now 12 years old and will be a teenager soon. We had a good time and two nice Birthday parties, one with his friends and one with family and our friends. Good times.

## django-debug-toolbar 4.0

[Django 4.2 was released](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/apr/03/django-42-released/), [Hatch gained support for the Django 4.2 Trove classifier](https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/762) and [we released django-debug-toolbar 4.0](https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/), with support for Django 4.2, psycopg 3 and all the existing goodies.

## feincms3-cookiecontrol

[feincms3-cookiecontrol](https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol/) has gained support for consciously embedding stuff via oEmbed. It can now use [Noembed](https://noembed.com/) (via [feincms3](https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3)'s external plugin) and only actually embed the third party content if users consented explicitly.

I have since learned through the [Datenschutz-Plaudereien](https://podcast.datenschutzpartner.ch/) podcast that laws regarding consent are not that strict in Switzerland compared to the European Union, also not when the [DSG](https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-90134.html) is put into effect in September. What's right and what's legal are two different things and while I don't really like the ubiquitous cookie banners (especially not when they aren't actually doing anything) I like the idea of explicit consent and of not sending data unnecessarily to third party providers. The additional click isn't that bad.

## Diving into hatch for Python packaging

I listened to the TalkPython podcast episode with Ofek Lev on [his Hatch packaging tool](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow). After a long period of uncertainty and waiting I bit the bullet and started to migrate a few of my Python packages from setuptools and `setup.py` to hatch and `pyproject.toml`, until now [feincms3-cookiecontrol](https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol) and [feincms3](https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3). It was surprisingly painless.

## ruff

I started learning Rust during the last [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/); it's a nice language. [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/) is a linter and (more and more) formatter for Python code written in Rust. After years of working with Python and Python-based tools it's surprisingly fast, almost worryingly so. It's true what they say: ruff finishes so fast that I'm always left wondering if it even did anything at all.

I'm configuring ruff through `pyproject.toml`, so switching from setuptools to hatch (see above) also helped in this regard. The main trouble I had was that I'm running Python 3.11 locally but Python 3.10 in the server environment (no dev-prod parity...), and rebuilding `requirements.txt` locally of course didn't add TOML support because it's built into Python 3.11, but Python 3.10 needs an external package. So of course I broke the build. That's not all bad though: If stuff broke it definitely helps with remembering the reasons later.

## Meta

Co-writing still works really well for me. Expressed differently: I seem to be unable to write without the (slight) pressure of writing together.
