## Tech won't save us

I have recently discovered [Tech won't save us](https://www.techwontsave.us/),
a Podcast which is critical of the technological "progress" offered by Silicon
Valley elites. It's a great antidote for the generative AI hype.

I still have some stupid hope that AGI will solve our problems because maybe
people will trust a computer more than scientists that something has to be done
about the combined crisis we're facing as humans. Who knows. I do not want to
be too negative about it though, there are positive news if you're looking in
the right places.

I myself do not write about those bigger issues [as
much](https://406.ch/writing/category-climate/) [as I used
to](https://406.ch/writing/category-politik/). I support those more important
issues elsewhere.

Generative AI is certainly not helping *me* in my work. I do not want a
computer to generate code which I have to review and maintain when I still
enjoy writing code myself. Maybe that will change at some point in the future.
When that happens I'll probably retire and become a gardener or something.
