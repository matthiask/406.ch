# Weeknotes (2023 week 18 and 19)

Not much programming this week :-(

## oEmbed

[Still occupying myself with oEmbed.](https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/) I have been looking at a few libraries and have rediscovered [micawber](https://github.com/coleifer/micawber/) which probably does everything I need. Yay, another reinvented wheel avoided. I haven't tested it yet but I'm quite sure that replacing the [oEmbed functionality in feincms3's external plugin](https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/feincms3/plugins/external.py) with micawber would be a good idea.

## Vacation

Vacation last week. Was nice. We went for a few hikes. I have learned that I'm
not totally free from giddiness anymore. Oh well.
