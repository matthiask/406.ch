## django-debug-toolbar alpha with async support!

I have helped mentoring Aman Pandey who has worked all summer to add async
support to
[django-debug-toolbar](https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar/).
[Tim](https://github.com/tim-schilling) has released an alpha which contains
all of the work up to a few days ago. Test it! Let's find the breakages before
the final release.


## Dropping Python 3.9 from my projects

I have read [Carlton's post about the only green Python release](https://noumenal.es/posts/the-only-green-python/yLw/) and have started dropping Python 3.9 support from many of the packages I maintain. This is such a good point:

> [...] Iâ€™m also thinking about it in terms of reducing the number of Python versions we support in CI. It feels like a lot of trees to support 5 full versions of Python for their entire life. ðŸŒ³

## Releases

- [django-debug-toolbar 5.0.0a0](https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/5.0.0a0/): See above.
- [form-designer 0.26.2](https://pypi.org/project/form-designer/): The values
  of choice fields are now returned as-is when sending mails or exporting form
  submissions instead of only returning the slugified version.
- [django-authlib 0.17.1](https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/): The
  [role-based permissions
  backend](https://406.ch/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/)
  had a bug where it wouldn't return all available permissions in all
  circumstances, leading to empty navigation sidebars in the Django
  administration. This has been fixed.
- [feincms3 5.2.3](https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/): Bugfix release, the
  page moving interface is no longer hidden by an expanded navigation sidebar.
  I almost always turn off the sidebar in my projects so I haven't noticed
  this.
- [django-prose-editor 0.8.1](https://pypi.org/project/django-prose-editor/):
  Contains the most recent ProseMirror updates and bugfixes.
- [django-content-editor
  7.0.10](https://pypi.org/project/django-content-editor/): Now supports
  sections. Separate blog post coming up!
