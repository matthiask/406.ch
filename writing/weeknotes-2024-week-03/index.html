I do not have anything to do with it really but I enjoy the idea a lot and maybe there will be a pull request or two to review.<h2 id=kubernetes><a class=toclink href=#kubernetes>Kubernetes</a></h2><p>After years and years of hosting all sites on VPS I have finally reached the point where the old setup is more annoying to work with than switching to a new one. I have searched long for a solution which wasn’t as limited as some PaaS and as complex as going full Kubernetes, and where I can still delegate the responsibility of actually keeping things up and running to other people. In the end I have now accepted that such a thing doesn’t exist; either you have the limitations of a ready made solution, the limitation of having to open many many support tickets or the problem of having to learn Kubernetes (or something similar) with its extremely steep learning curve.<p>After spending days with it I’m slowly getting to the point where setting up local development environments and deploying changes is fun again. I’m using the GitOps paradigm; while I’m still building and uploading Docker (podman) images from the local development environment everything else is automated and goes through a Git based process. That’s much nicer than clicking around in some interface or copy pasting obscure commands into the console.<p>The biggest problem I encountered was (perhaps unsurprisingly) managing secrets as a team. It seems to me that while <a href=https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/>sealed secrets</a> work great as an individual developer they don’t really offer straightforward solutions to avoid different people overwriting and resetting each others secrets when updating them. I’m a happy user of the external secrets operator and using some cloud service to actually store those secrets.<p>I have started using <a href=https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/>granian</a> in production. I like the idea of a Rust-based ASGI/WSGI server. Nothing mission critical yet. My idea is to build confidence in the software stack.<h2 id=compulsory-social-measures><a class=toclink href=#compulsory-social-measures>Compulsory social measures</a></h2><p>The more I learn about how Switzerland treats its citizens the more I wonder about the ways in which humans can mistreat other humans in a so called civilized and peaceful society.<p>It’s not exactly a new topic for me, but working on platforms which help remember and which help introducing people to the history certainly causes a heightened awareness for issues such as these.<p><a href=https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/en/home/gesellschaft/fszm.html>More on this</a>.<h2 id=releases><a class=toclink href=#releases>Releases</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/>feincms3-sites 0.20.2</a>: It previously wasn’t possible to filter the list of sites to only show those sites which do <em>not</em> have a default language. This has been fixed.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-json-schema-editor/>django-json-schema-editor 0.0.10</a>: It’s now actually possible to use the JSON editor outside inlines! That was a fun bug… not. Apart from the mentioned bug this new release mostly contains fixes to the styles. We’re slowly getting there.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-mptt/>django-mptt 0.16</a>: I didn’t do anything except for the changelog and the release. That’s alright. The release contains a few minor fixes.</ul></div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/django-ckeditor/>Previous post</a><a href=/writing/weeknotes-2024-week-01/>Next post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2024 week 03)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-01-17 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
