Oh well.<h2>django-debug-toolbar 4.1</h2><p>We have released <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/>django-debug-toolbar 4.1</a>. Another cycle where I mostly contributed reviews and not much else. Feels great :-)<h2>Going all in on hatch and hatchling</h2><p>I got to know hatch because django-debug-toolbar was converted to it. I was confused as probably anyone else with the new state of packaging in Python world. After listening to a few Podcasts (for example <a href=https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow>Hatch: A Modern Python Workflow</a>) I did bite the bullet and started converting projects to hatch as mentioned <a href=https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-13-and-14/>some time ago</a>. I have converted a few other projects in the meantime because the development experience is nicer. Not much, but enough to make it worthwile. <a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/>feincms3-sites</a> is the latest package I converted.<h2>CKEditor 5’s new license and django-ckeditor</h2><p>The pressure is on to maybe switch away from CKEditor 4 since it probably will not be supported after <a href=https://support.ckeditor.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005281629-How-long-will-CKEditor-4-be-supported->June 2023</a>. It’s totally understandable that the CKEditor 5 license isn’t the same as before, but I’m not sure what that means for the Django integration <a href=https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/issues/482>django-ckeditor</a> which I’m maintaining since a few years. I don’t actually like the new capabilities of CKEditor all that much and don’t intend to use them; maybe it would be better to use a build of <a href>ProseMirror</a> in the CMS since <a href=https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#about-rich-text-editors>we’re intentionally only using a very small subset of the features most rich text editors offer</a>.<h2>Mountain biking.</h2><p>My mountain bike is repaired, I’m back on the trail.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 24)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-06-16 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a>, <a href=/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
