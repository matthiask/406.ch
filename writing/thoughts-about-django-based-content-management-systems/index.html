The big three systems many years back were <a href=https://www.django-cms.org/>django CMS</a>, <a href=https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine>Mezzanine</a> and <a href=https://feinheit.ch>our</a> own <a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-future-of-feincms/>FeinCMS</a>.<p>During all this time I have always kept an eye open for other CMS than our own but have steadily continued working in my small corner of the Django space. I think it’s time to write down why I have been doing this all this time, for myself and possibly also for other interested parties.<h2 id=why-not-use-wagtail-django-cms-or-any-of-those-alternatives><a class=toclink href=#why-not-use-wagtail-django-cms-or-any-of-those-alternatives>Why not use Wagtail, django CMS or any of those alternatives?</a></h2><p>Let’s start with the big one. Why not use Wagtail?<p>The Django administration interface is actually great. Even though some people say that it should be treated as a tool for developers only, recent improvements to the accessibility and the general usability suggest otherwise. I have written more about my views on this in <a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-django-admin-is-a-cms/>The Django admin is a CMS</a>. Using and building on top of the Django admin is a great way to immediately profit from all current and future improvements without having to reimplement anything.<p>I don’t want to have to reimplement Django’s features, I want to add what I need on top.<h2 id=faster-updates><a class=toclink href=#faster-updates>Faster updates</a></h2><p>Everyone implementing and maintaining other CMS is doing a great job and I don’t want to throw any shade. I still feel that it’s important to point out that systems can make it hard to adopt new Django versions on release day:<ul><li>The update cycle of many large apps using Django lag behind Django. Wagtail declares an <a href=https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/12574>upper version boundary for Django</a> which makes it hard to adopt Django versions faster than Wagtail releases updates.<li>Some django CMS components such as <a href=https://github.com/django-cms/django-filer>django-filer</a> have lagged behind in the past. Looking at the project’s CI matrix and activity suggests that this is not the case anymore. That said, a <a href=https://406.ch/writing/django-cabinet-a-media-library-for-django/>simpler alternative exists</a>.</ul><p>These larger systems have many more (very talented) people working on them. I’m not saying I’m doing a better job. I’m only pointing out that I’m following a different philosophy where I’m <a href=https://406.ch/writing/run-less-code-in-production-or-youll-end-up-paying-the-price-later/>conservative about running code in production</a> and I’d rather <a href=https://406.ch/writing/low-maintenance-software/>have less features when the price is a lot of maintenance later</a>. I’m always thinking about long term maintenance. I really don’t want to maintain some of these larger projects, or even parts of them. So I’d rather not adopt them for projects which hopefully will be developed and maintained for a long time to come. By the way: This experience has been earned the hard way.<h2 id=the-rule-of-least-power><a class=toclink href=#the-rule-of-least-power>The rule of least power</a></h2><p>From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power>Wikipedia</a>:<blockquote><p>In programming, the rule of least power is a design principle that “suggests choosing the least powerful [computer] language suitable for a given purpose”. Stated alternatively, given a choice among computer languages, classes of which range from descriptive (or declarative) to procedural, the less procedural, more descriptive the language one chooses, the more one can do with the data stored in that language.</blockquote><p>Django itself already provides lots and lots of power. I’d argue that a very powerful platform on top of Django may be too much of a good thing. I’d rather keep it simple and stupid.<h2 id=editing-heterogenous-collections-of-content><a class=toclink href=#editing-heterogenous-collections-of-content>Editing heterogenous collections of content</a></h2><p>Django admin’s inlines are great, but they are not sufficient for building a CMS. You need something to manage different types. django-content-editor does that and has done that since 2009.<p><a href=https://torchbox.com/blog/rich-text-fields-and-faster-horses/>When Wagtail introduced the StreamField in 2015</a> it was definitely a great update to an already great CMS but it wasn’t a new idea generally and not a new thing in Django land. They didn’t say it was and <a href=https://406.ch/writing/i-just-learned-about-wagtail-s-streamfield/>welcomed the fact that they also started using a better way to structure content</a>.<p>Structured content is great. Putting everything into one large rich text area isn’t what I want. Django’s ORM and admin interface are great for actually modelling the data in a reusable way. And when you need more flexibility than what’s offered by Django’s forms, the community offers many projects extending the admin. These days, I really like working with the <a href=https://406.ch/writing/django-json-schema-editor/>django-json-schema-editor</a> component; I even reference other model instances in the database and let the JSON editor handle the referential integrity transparently for me (so that referenced model instances do not silently disappear).<h2 id=more-reading><a class=toclink href=#more-reading>More reading</a></h2><p><a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-future-of-feincms/>The future of FeinCMS</a> and the <a href=https://406.ch/writing/category-feincms/>feincms category</a> may be interesting. Also, I’d love to talk about these thoughts, either by email or on Mastodon.</div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2025-week-49/>Newer post</a><a href=https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2025-week-45/>Older post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Thoughts about Django-based content management systems">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2025-11-05 in <a href=https://406.ch/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=https://406.ch/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=https://406.ch/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
