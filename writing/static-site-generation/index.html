Markdown is great for blogging and I have been using it for a long time, basically since I started this website in 2005. I don’t like it that much for documentation, but that’s a story for another day.<p>For now I still deploy the blog to a VPS but there’s nothing stopping me from uploading it somewhere else. I’m thinking about using GitHub actions for the deployment, but I can do that another day.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Static site generation">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-04-15 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
