I decided then that I didn’t want to subscribe to any products of these companies with my personal money anymore. In my case, this meant only Google. I do have an iPhone (the first iPhone since the 3GS or something) but I’m not paying any subscriptions there either.<p>I have been a paying Google subscriber for years and years, starting in their “Don’t be evil” area and sticking with them as the product and the companies ethics got worse and worse.<h2 id=gmail><a class=toclink href=#gmail>GMail</a></h2><p>I have switched my private mail to <a href=https://www.fastmail.com/>Fastmail</a> a few years ago, so I haven’t been really using GMail anymore.<p>GMail is still a really good email service. In the last few weeks the AI features have become hard to overlook and/or ignore though, and I’m not really happy about that. Fastmail shows more restraint in this area.<h2 id=google-calendar><a class=toclink href=#google-calendar>Google Calendar</a></h2><p>We have shared family calendars using Google Calendar. Now I do not have a private calendar anymore, and am using the Work calendar for everything. That’s a small setback. Fastmail also has a calendar functionality but sharing read/write calendars doesn’t seem to be easily possible except if others are in the same account group.<h2 id=google-drive-and-google-photos><a class=toclink href=#google-drive-and-google-photos>Google Drive and Google Photos</a></h2><p>I don’t miss the Drive all that much. The things I’m working on are versioned with <a href=https://git-scm.com/>Git</a>, and since I’m switching from desktop to notebook all the time anyway everything is already backuped and synced everywhere. For everything else I have started renting a <a href=https://www.hetzner.com/de/storage/storage-box/>Storage Box at Hetzner</a>. I’m paying a few euros per month for 1 TiB of storage which is accessible by several protocols.<h2 id=docs-spreadsheets><a class=toclink href=#docs-spreadsheets>Docs / Spreadsheets</a></h2><p><a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/>LibreOffice</a> exists and fits my needs. Whenever possible I use pen and paper or flat text files anyway.<h2 id=maps><a class=toclink href=#maps>Maps</a></h2><p>I have been a happy <a href=https://osmand.net/>OsmAnd</a> subscriber anyway. I’m still paying for it but have been using <a href=https://organicmaps.app/>Organic Maps</a> more often now because the app feels faster and nicer.<h2 id=youtube-and-youtube-music><a class=toclink href=#youtube-and-youtube-music>YouTube and YouTube Music</a></h2><p>I’m very happy with <a href=https://bandcamp.com/>Bandcamp</a> and have been buying music there for years now. I don’t think the app is great though.<p>I have tried several apps, and have now settled on <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/foobar2000/id1072807669>foobar2000</a>. It works well and includes an FTP server which I can use to push the library from the computer to the phone using a <a href=https://lftp.yar.ru/>lftp</a> script.<p>I looked into setting up by own streaming server but haven’t gotten anywhere with that project yet, and I’m not sure if I really want to pursue that.<p>On the computer I’m back to using <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox>Rhythmbox</a>.<p>Not having a YouTube subscription is great, because all the ads are so annoying that I’m spending less time on YouTube than I did in years. And if I really want to watch something <a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>yt-dlp</a> exists and does what it says on the tin.<h2 id=other-things><a class=toclink href=#other-things>Other things</a></h2><p>I have been playing <a href=https://ingress.com/>Ingress</a> for over 10 years. It didn’t immediately register that I also deleted that account with my Google account. I’m still a bit sad when thinking about all the badges I lost, but it has been definitely worth it.<p>Google Keep has worked well for me for small To Dos, reminders and notes. I haven’t found an acceptable replacement yet; Apple Notes works somewhat, but cannot be accessed on the web if you’re using their advanced data protection feature. Maybe I need a To Do app, but this space is so crowded that I don’t even want to start searching for something with fits my needs.<p>At work we’re still using Google Workspace. It would probably be in our interest to change that though.</div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/weeknotes-2025-week-15/>Previous post</a><a href=/writing/til-tools-exist-which-do-not-lowercase-domain-names-when-requesting-websites-over-http-s/>Next post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Ungoogling my life">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2025-03-12 </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
