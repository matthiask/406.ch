I’m recovering quite quickly it seems and I’m glad about it.<p>This weeknotes entry is short and quick. I’m trying to get back into the habit of writing them after a mediocre start this year.<h2>20th Anniversary Celebration of Young Greens Switzerland</h2><p>I have attended the celebration of Young Greens Switzerland. I have been a founding member and have been active for close to ten years. A lot of time has passed since then. It has been great to reminisce about old times with friends and, more importantly, to see how the torch is carried on.<h2>Releases</h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/blacknoise/>blacknoise 0.0.5</a>: blacknoise is an ASGI app for static file serving inspired by <a href=https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>whitenoise</a>. It only supports a very limited subset of whitenoise’s functionality, but it supports async.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/>html-sanitizer 2.4.1</a>: The lxml library moved the HTML cleaner into its own package, <a href=https://pypi.org/project/lxml-html-clean/>lxml-html-clean</a>; this release adds support for that. I didn’t know that the HTML cleaner is viewed as being problematic by the lxml maintainers. I’m having another look at <a href=https://github.com/messense/nh3>nh3</a> and will maybe switch html-sanitizer’s guts from lxml to nh3 in the future.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-tree-queries/>django-tree-queries 0.18</a>: django-tree-queries now supports ordering siblings by multiple fields and even allows descending orderings.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-cabinet/>django-cabinet 0.14.2</a>: This release fixes the CKEditor 4 filebrowser popup when using Django 5 or better.</ul></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2024 week 14)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-04-06 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-politik/>Politik</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
