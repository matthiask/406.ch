As I wrote in my 2020 blog post <a href=https://406.ch/writing/using-environment-variables-to-configure-django/>Using environment variables to configure Django</a> I liked using them – a lot. However, this has changed a bit because I don’t like the fact that all released versions of those libraries modify the <code>urllib.uses_netloc</code> list with their own protocols (when it’s not necessary at all) and I don’t like it either that some bugs still exist in some libraries which make upgrading projects in our environments from Django 3.2 to Django 4.0 harder than it should be; the problem isn’t really caused by Django’s new built-in features but rather surfaced by it.<p>Anyway, since I already had a library which helped reading settings from the environment, adding another utility which transforms DSNs to configuration dictionaries understood by Django was straightforward. And that’s why I’m now happily using <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/speckenv/#django-support>speckenv’s Django support</a> for those use cases.<p>Reducing the amount of dependencies in a project maybe shouldn’t be a goal in itself, but replacing generic utilities with more opinionated utilities is certainly a net positive in my book (if it is possible!)</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Configuring Django backends using speckenv’s 12factor support">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2022-08-18 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
