Strings cannot be used anymore in places where the sanitizer expects a set (resp. any iterable). It’s useful that strings are iterable in Python and I wouldn’t want to change that, but the fact that <code>("class")</code> is a string and not a tuple makes me sad. The fact that tuples are created by <code>,</code> and not by <code>()</code> will always trip up people.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/>feincms3-language-sites 0.1</a>: The version number is wrong but whatever. I’m certainly happy with the state of things. The big change in 0.1 is that <code>Page.get_absolute_url</code> no longer generates protocol-relative URLs. Depending on the value of <code>SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT</code> it automatically prepends either <code>http:</code> or <code>https:</code>.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/>django-authlib 0.15</a>: django-authlib’s admin Single Sign On module now supports a hook to automatically create staff users when a matching user doesn’t exist already. I don’t plan to use this functionality myself and I have recommended people to implement the functionality themselves using the tools in django-authlib if they need it, but the change was so small and well-contained that adding it to the core made sense to me.</ul><h2>pipx inject</h2><p>We learned that <a href=https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>pipx</a> seems to remember injected packages even across <code>pipx reinstall</code> invocations. Not too surprising now that we know it, but we certainly spent some time scratching our heads. <code>pipx
uninject</code> was the thing we needed to stop pipx from installing an old version of a dependency instead of the one being specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.<h2>hatchling and data files</h2><p>I’m very confused by the way <a href=https://hatch.pypa.io/>hatchling</a> sometimes includes data files and sometimes it doesn’t. I had to add <code>[tool.hatch.build]
include=["authlib/"]</code> to <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/commit/67d4673e4039eac277b5d2557c0736c1f01442ac>django-authlib’s <code>pyproject.toml</code> file</a> to make it include HTML files from subpackages. Maybe the subpackages are the reason, but I’m not sure.<h2>Payment providers that must not be named</h2><p>I have spent hours and hours battling with the badly documented, incomplete, inconsistent and confusing API of a (not that well known) payment provider based in Switzerland. I’m surprised that this still happens years and years after Stripe started offering a really well thought out and documented API geared towards programmers. It’s really sad because when the same structure is named with differing naming conventions (e.g. <code>snake_case</code> vs. <code>camelCase</code>) in different parts of the API you just know that somebody spent too much time writing too much code instead of reusing already existing functionality.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 28)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-07-12 in <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a>, <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
