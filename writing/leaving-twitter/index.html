I enjoyed it, sometimes more, sometimes less.<p>I liked a lot that Twitter offered me a way to follow the thoughts and works of interesting people.<p>It surfaced ways of thinking and cultures which I probably wouldn’t have learned about otherwise.<p>In the last few years and (of course) especially in the last few weeks things god worse very quickly. I don’t want to be a part of the Twitter community anymore. I’m not sure if my use of Twitter helps or costs Twitter anything, but this doesn’t really matter all that much.<p>What matters is that I have all that and more by using RSS and Mastodon. I’ve never stopped using RSS and I have found <a href=https://theoldreader.com/>The Old Reader</a> to be a good replacement for Google Reader and have been using it ever since (if I do not misremember things). The social network which I am happy to be a part of on Mastodon checks all boxes which my leaving Twitter left unchecked and even a few additional checkboxes I didn’t even know. So, that’s good for now.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Leaving Twitter">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2022-11-12 in <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
