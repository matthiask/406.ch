The default value is 1 which corresponds to the old default so that the change wonâ€™t be backwards incompatible. However, youâ€™ll always get a deprecation warning if you donâ€™t set a bigger value yourself. The default will probably change in the future.<h2>Advent of Code</h2><p>I have always felt a bit as an imposter because I do not have any formal CS education; not so much in the last few years but certainly earlier in my career. I have enjoyed participating in the <a href=https://adventofcode.com/>Advent of Code 2022</a> a lot and I have definitely learned to know when to use and how to use a few algorithms I didnâ€™t even know before. Iâ€™m again working through the puzzles in my own pace and have managed to solve almost all of them up to today this year. There still are some puzzles where I donâ€™t even know how to start the second part ðŸ˜….<h2>Hosting</h2><p>Weâ€™re still hosting most sites on virtualized servers, without any containers or any of the new stuff. Iâ€™m finally reaching the point where the downsides of this approach start to drag new projects down and the workarounds start looking worse than maybe switching to containers or even Kubernetes. Wish me luck, Iâ€™m more confused than Iâ€™ve been in years.<h2>Health</h2><p>To absolutely nobodyâ€™s surprise the family and myself have continued to be sick in the last two weeks. Nothing really bad happened, so weâ€™re still lucky.<p>Thereâ€™s unfortunately no way to solve a societal problem individually, so that will probably continue to be our life for now.<h2>Releases</h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-imagefield/>django-imagefield 0.18</a>: See above.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/>feincms3-sites 0.20.1</a>: Added additional validation (cleaning) checks. Showing error messages is preferrable to crashing with <code>IntegrityError</code> exceptions after all.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/>django-js-asset 2.2.0</a>: Hatchling seems to dislike it if the project name and the Python module name do not match. I actually like <code>django-js-asset</code>â€™s Python module to be <code>js_asset</code> but Iâ€™m beginning to rethink this decision.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-json-schema-editor/>django-json-schema-editor 0.0.4</a>: See <a href=https://406.ch/writing/django-json-schema-editor/>the post from this week</a>.</ul></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 50)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>â˜• Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-12-15 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
