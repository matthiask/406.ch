That being said, for new CMS projects I’m more likely to use django-content-editor and feincms3. This series of blog posts offers an appreciation for my most successful open source project and hopefully also offers insights into my plans and the reasoning behind them.<ul><li><a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-state-of-things-in-feincms-1x-land/>The state of things in FeinCMS 1.x land</a><li><a href=https://406.ch/writing/what-did-feincms-get-right/>What did FeinCMS get right?</a><li><a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-other-future-of-feincms-django-content-editor-and-feincms3/>The other future of FeinCMS: django-content-editor and feincms3</a><li><a href=https://406.ch/writing/bringing-feincms-and-django-content-editorfeincms3-closer-together/>Bringing FeinCMS and django-content-editor/feincms3 closer together</a></ul><p>Here’s a link to all posts in the <a href=https://406.ch/writing/category-feincms/?o=chronological>feincms category</a> if you want to follow along.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=The future of FeinCMS">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2018-09-22 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
