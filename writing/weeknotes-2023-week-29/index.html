Not much to talk about. Except for the ZIP file <code>content-type</code> bug which was interesting enough to justify <a href=https://406.ch/writing/serving-zip-files-using-django/>its own blog post</a>.<h2>Releases</h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-cabinet/>django-cabinet 0.13</a>: I converted the package to use ruff, hatchling; started running CI tests using Python 3.11. The internals of the Django admin’s filters have changed to allow multi-valued filters, this has required some changes to the implementation of the folder filter. I opted to using a relatively ugly <code>django.VERSION</code> hack; but that’s not too bad since such branches will be automatically removed by the awesome <a href=https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade>django-upgrade</a>. I would have tried finding other ways in the past but now that old compatibility code can be removed by a single run of <code>django-upgrade</code> (respectively <code>pre-commit</code>) there really is no point to doing it in a different way.</ul></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 29)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-07-21 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
