The Django app comes with a management command <code>./manage.py process_imagefields</code> to help with this. I have added parallel processing based on <code>concurrent.futures</code> to it some time ago so that the command completes faster when it is being run on a system with several cores.<p>A work colleague is using macOS (many are, in fact), and he always got multiprocessing Python crashes. This is a well known issue and I remember reading about it a few years ago. I checked the docs and saw that the <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html><code>concurrent.futures</code></a> page doesn’t mention macOS, but <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html><code>multiprocessing</code></a> does. So, I hoped that a simple rewrite of the management command using <code>multiprocessing</code> might fix it.<p>Because I was in a rush and really didn’t want to do it I turned to an AI assistant for doing this boring work. To my surprise it immediately produced a version which I could easily fix by hand to produce a working version. Of course, the initial response was totally broken, removed code it wasn’t supposed to, and even the syntax was invalid. I didn’t expect more though, but what was surprising was that it actually felt like I had to do less work at this time.<p>The assistant also helped adding a <code>--no-parallel</code> flag to the management command. The output was even more broken than the output of the change mentioned above, but again, I could easily fix it to achieve what I wanted.<p>The fact that I know the code and <a href=https://git-scm.com/>git</a> well certainly helped, the assistant would really have helped without that knowledge.<p>In the end, switching to <code>multiprocessing</code> didn’t help, but adding the <code>--no-parallel</code> flag allowed them to run the processing themselves by not spawning any additional threads or processes.<p>The energy use and the stealing of copyrighted material done by the AI companies is still really bad. It does feel somewhat OK to use an AI assistant in an area where I’m proficient as well and where I probably also supplied training material (without being asked if I wanted this) though. It’s making me slightly faster, and doesn’t allow me to do things I really couldn’t otherwise.<h2 id=releases><a class=toclink href=#releases>Releases</a></h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/FeinCMS/>FeinCMS 24.12.3</a>: I have added a TinyMCE 7 integration to FeinCMS.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-imagefield/>django-imagefield 0.21.1</a>: See above.</ul></div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/django-admin-tip-adding-links-to-related-objects-in-change-forms/>Previous post</a><a href=/writing/weeknotes-2024-week-51/>Next post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2025 week 03)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2025-01-15 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
