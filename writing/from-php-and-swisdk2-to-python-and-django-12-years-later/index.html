We were using PHP at the time and had our own framework, the <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/swisdk2/>SWISDK – Simple Web Infrastructure SDK</a>; quite a mouthful. It supported many features which are now commonplace in web frameworks such as an ORM, a mostly autogenerated admin interface, forms which could be used together with models, some sort of routing, generic views<sup id=fnref:viewsets><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:viewsets>2</a></sup>, XSS and CSRF protection, support for translations in the code and the database, images, galleries, comments etc.<p>I think I had <a href=https://www.djangoproject.com/>Django</a> on my radar for quite a while already. I liked the template language and especially the template inheritance feature so much that I reimplemented it as an extension to the <a href=https://www.smarty.net/>Smarty template engine</a>. Smarty has built-in support for template inheritance since 2009 but I didn’t profit from this anymore, because we migrated to Python and Django in 2007/2008<sup id=fnref:2007><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:2007>3</a></sup> and have never looked back. This was after manipulators had been replaced by the newforms library (the current <code>django.forms</code>) but before the newforms admin and before Django 1.0.<p>I also took a long and hard look at <a href=https://rubyonrails.org/>Ruby on Rails</a> as an alternative. Ruby used and uses too much interpunction for my taste. Writing this down does not make it sound or feel better – as a reason it still sounds as meaningless as ever.<p>The decisive push factors were:<ul><li>For me, PHP wasn’t a fun language anymore. The inconsistencies were annoying at best (e.g. the order of needle and haystack in various function signatures).<li>Maintaining an in-house framework was to expensive in terms of hours and energy. The maintenance and continued development occupied a significant portion of my time and I just couldn’t continue taking the responsibility for this.</ul><p>Pull factors for Python and Django were:<ul><li>I didn’t get Django’s manipulators a year earlier but I immediately saw that <code>django.forms</code> were more-or-less a drop-in replacement for what we had in SWISDK2. Of course, Django has grown and improved since and SWISDK2 has been … dead.<li>Django’s administration interface (!!) – it was and still is an awesome piece of engineering.</ul><p>Python and Django, both the language and the community hasn’t let me down and I hope the same is true vice versa. The excellent <a href=https://2020.djangocon.eu/>DjangoCon EU 2020</a> has only helped making me ever more glad about that choice.<p>Here’s to ten more years of Python and Django – also at <a href=https://feinheit.ch/>Feinheit</a>.<div class=footnote><hr><ol><li id=fn:oaat><p>A bit more than 14 years ago.
