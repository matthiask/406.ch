Hotlinking images hosted in GitHub issues doesnâ€™t work anymore it seems.<li>The execution time isnâ€™t reported anymore.<li>The script now supports scheduled publishing, mainly by leveraging GitHub actionâ€™s scheduling support.</ul><h2>Has it been worth it?</h2><p>The general advice seems to not write your own static site generator because youâ€™ll spend time tweaking the generator instead of actually writing posts. This definitely doesnâ€™t have to be the case. Sometimes itâ€™s good to hack on a small projects just for the joy of it. I certainly enjoy the fact that my code (arguably ðŸ™ƒ) does something useful each time I publish a new post.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Eleven months of static site generation">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>â˜• Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-03-15 in <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
