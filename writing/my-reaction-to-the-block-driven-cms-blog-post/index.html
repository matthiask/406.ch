It shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise to those (few ðŸ˜„) who know my work in the area of content management systems that the post resonated with me. I found the description of the advantages of block-based CMS editing very clear and I like the emphasis on structuring data well so that it can be reused for multiple distribution channels.<p>Of course <a href=https://www.django-cms.org/>django CMS</a> isnâ€™t the only way to implement a block-driven CMS using Django. Since its inception <a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-future-of-feincms/>FeinCMS</a> was always the smaller, faster and nimbler counterpart to it, achieving the same <em>basic</em> goals with a fraction of the code and maintenance headaches. django CMS always seems to trail the official releases of Django. django-content-editor and feincms3 are almost always compatible with the development version of Django by way of running the tests with the <code>main</code> branch as well. This allows me to be an early adopter of upcoming Django releases with a software stack thatâ€™s already well tested, or also to report bugs to the Django project itself. All that probably wouldnâ€™t be possible if feincms3 and its dependencies supported all the things django CMS does, but it doesnâ€™t have to to be useful.<p><a href=https://406.ch/writing/the-other-future-of-feincms-django-content-editor-and-feincms3/>django-content-editor and feincms3</a> are the legacy of FeinCMS in an even smaller, even more maintainable and even more composable package and while Iâ€™m definitely always checking out other Django-based CMS Iâ€™m persuaded that sticking with feincms3 is a good choice.</div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/>Previous post</a><a href=/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-33/>Next post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=My reaction to the block-driven CMS blog post">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>â˜• Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-08-23 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
