The admin itself was created to allow quickly spinning up new websites, where the admin interface was used by content managers to fill in the content while programmers finalized the rest of the website. So obviously the admin interface was a system used to manage content<sup id=fnref:words><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:words>1</a></sup> from the beginning.<p>Sure, the <a href=https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/admin/>Django admin site documentation</a> states:<blockquote><p>One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on your site. The admin’s recommended use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool. <strong>It’s not intended for building your entire front end around.</strong> [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>In other words, the Django documentation also points out that the admin is powerful and that it allows trusted users to manage content<sup id=fnref2:words><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:words>1</a></sup>.<p>Yes, it will be very painful if you try to do everything on top of the Django admin site. The warnings against using the Django admin for more than it was designed to are necessary and I totally support them. As soon as you’re getting into workflows, into complex permission scenarios (sad noises) or similar things the admin definitely isn’t for you. But, the admin nicely solves 90% of the problems with 10% of the effort. And it’s very good at that.<p>And sure, if you try building your own frontend on top of the Django admin you’re in for a bumpy ride, but that much should be obvious.<p>Many third party apps for Django actually target the Django admin interface itself, and not one of the (excellent!) Django-based CMS such as <a href=https://wagtail.org/>Wagtail</a>. This means that by building on the Django admin instead of one of the CMS you’re <a href=https://406.ch/writing/run-less-code-in-production-or-youll-end-up-paying-the-price-later/>running less code</a>, by using more libraries instead of frameworks (on top of frameworks) you’re <a href=https://406.ch/writing/low-maintenance-software/>keeping maintenance lower</a>, and you’re a part of a larger community<sup id=fnref:community><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:community>2</a></sup>, which brings the potential benefit of being able to profit more from the general Django packages ecosystem.<p>Since you’re depending on smaller pieces of additional software it will generally be possible to upgrade to new Django versions quicker. This isn’t true for all packages of course, and I’m a reluctant maintainer of some of them. Anecdotes aren’t data, but I see that some larger CMS systems are definitely having a hard time keeping up with Django’s release schedule.<p>I’m not trying to say that the Django admin is a better CMS than other Django-based CMS, or any other CMS. I’m saying it’s a trade off and you should be mindful of the downsides of choosing a larger system. And I’m saying that the people who tell you that you shouldn’t be using the Django admin interface are wrong in the first approximation.<p>The fact that it’s so easy to spin up an additional site and with minimal effort and still be able to work with clean database schemas and all the great tools Django (and Python) offers is important for those of us who are working on many different projects with limited financial resources, because the website often is for example just a small part of a campaign.<div class=footnote><hr><ol><li id=fn:words><p>Sorry-not-sorry for my choice of words. <a title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text" class=footnote-backref href=#fnref:words>↩</a><a title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text" class=footnote-backref href=#fnref2:words>↩</a></p><li id=fn:community><p>The assumption that the communities of these Django-based CMS projects are a subset of the Django community itself shouldn’t be too controversial. <a title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text" class=footnote-backref href=#fnref:community>↩</a></p></ol></div></div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/weeknotes-2024-week-14/>Newer post</a><a href=/writing/blacknoise-asgi-app-for-static-file-serving/>Older post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=The Django admin is a CMS">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-03-27 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
