My old coding style was too dense. It’s hard to parse for a human mind because it lacks whitespace, which in turn means that less brain capacity is available for the actual functionality.<p>Code I’ve written a few years ago is also often too smart, using nested list comprehensions, lambdas and reduce all over the place. Those techniques are sometimes useful, and they really can make code easier to understand. But too often they were only used as a tool to put more behavior into less lines of code.<p>Nowadays, the deployment scripts always run <a href=http://flake8.readthedocs.org/>flake8</a> and abort if any warnings come up. It enforces a more readable coding style and also finds real errors from time to time before they hit production (or the staging environment).<p>It’s actually the same about <a href=http://www.gnome.org/>GNOME</a> or OS X vs. <a href=http://www.fvwm.org/>FVWM</a> (which I’ve been using a few years during the last decade). In the end, creating and justifying my own code style, my own environment always was too much work with doubtful gains.<p>Sometimes it <strong>is</strong> worth it to deviate from the trodden path. <strong>Coding style</strong> isn’t one of those areas.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=flake8 and the value of standards">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2014-08-08 in <a href=/writing/category-programming//>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
