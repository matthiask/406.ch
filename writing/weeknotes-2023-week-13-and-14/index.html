We had a good time and two nice Birthday parties, one with his friends and one with family and our friends. Good times.<h2>django-debug-toolbar 4.0</h2><p><a href=https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/apr/03/django-42-released/>Django 4.2 was released</a>, <a href=https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/762>Hatch gained support for the Django 4.2 Trove classifier</a> and <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/>we released django-debug-toolbar 4.0</a>, with support for Django 4.2, psycopg 3 and all the existing goodies.<h2>feincms3-cookiecontrol</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol/>feincms3-cookiecontrol</a> has gained support for consciously embedding stuff via oEmbed. It can now use <a href=https://noembed.com/>Noembed</a> (via <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3>feincms3</a>‘s external plugin) and only actually embed the third party content if users consented explicitly.<p>I have since learned through the <a href=https://podcast.datenschutzpartner.ch/>Datenschutz-Plaudereien</a> podcast that laws regarding consent are not that strict in Switzerland compared to the European Union, also not when the <a href=https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-90134.html>DSG</a> is put into effect in September. What’s right and what’s legal are two different things and while I don’t really like the ubiquitous cookie banners (especially not when they aren’t actually doing anything) I like the idea of explicit consent and of not sending data unnecessarily to third party providers. The additional click isn’t that bad.<h2>Diving into hatch for Python packaging</h2><p>I listened to the TalkPython podcast episode with Ofek Lev on <a href=https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow>his Hatch packaging tool</a>. After a long period of uncertainty and waiting I bit the bullet and started to migrate a few of my Python packages from setuptools and <code>setup.py</code> to hatch and <code>pyproject.toml</code>, until now <a href=https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol>feincms3-cookiecontrol</a> and <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3>feincms3</a>. It was surprisingly painless.<h2>ruff</h2><p>I started learning Rust during the last <a href=https://adventofcode.com/>Advent of Code</a>; it’s a nice language. <a href=https://beta.ruff.rs/>ruff</a> is a linter and (more and more) formatter for Python code written in Rust. After years of working with Python and Python-based tools it’s surprisingly fast, almost worryingly so. It’s true what they say: ruff finishes so fast that I’m always left wondering if it even did anything at all.<p>I’m configuring ruff through <code>pyproject.toml</code>, so switching from setuptools to hatch (see above) also helped in this regard. The main trouble I had was that I’m running Python 3.11 locally but Python 3.10 in the server environment (no dev-prod parity…), and rebuilding <code>requirements.txt</code> locally of course didn’t add TOML support because it’s built into Python 3.11, but Python 3.10 needs an external package. So of course I broke the build. That’s not all bad though: If stuff broke it definitely helps with remembering the reasons later.<h2>Meta</h2><p>Co-writing still works really well for me. Expressed differently: I seem to be unable to write without the (slight) pressure of writing together.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 13 and 14)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-04-05 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
