&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.1.2"&gt;ruff v0.1.2&lt;/a&gt; includes
the beta version of the ruff formatter. It formats the code almost the same way
as black, but much much faster. I have started switching projects I&amp;rsquo;m working
on and the experience has been nothing but great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;100% test coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have again fixed a bad bug in code which had 100% test coverage. It&amp;rsquo;s not
news that 100% test coverage isn&amp;rsquo;t a recipe for bug-free code, and it&amp;rsquo;s
probably not even worth optimizing for that metric in code. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing more
but a proxy for what you should really measure. Nevertheless it certainly does
feel good to achieve high coverage values!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No releases at all.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 42)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-42/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-42/</id><published>2023-10-18T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-10-18T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 42)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vacation in Italy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spent a wonderful family week in Italy. The voyage by train was very
comfortable and we had a great time there. I have lived close to lakes all my
life but the sea is always something else. Now I enjoy the cold temperatures of
fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going back (forward) to GitJournal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried several note taking apps but I&amp;rsquo;m now back using
&lt;a href="https://gitjournal.io/"&gt;GitJournal&lt;/a&gt; with a Git repository filled with Markdown
notes. It works well enough. I just wish that there was a way to make notes
more distinguishable and I wish that the editor was more forgiving when
encountering badly formatted checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analog blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long wanted to write about &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/"&gt;our switch from Slack to
Discord&lt;/a&gt;.
I have started to write this post with pen and paper. I find that I think
better when using pen and paper than when using the computer keyboard. One
factor is certainly that the computer offers more distractions, but I suspect
that another, more important factor is that as a fast typist the fingers and
the thinking are always getting out of step, and this happens less when using a
slower method of writing. This actually isn&amp;rsquo;t an idea I had myself, but I don&amp;rsquo;t
remember where I got it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero-based versioning: Good or bad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href="https://0ver.org/"&gt;ZeroVer&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the last few days. I have
many many Django packages with zero-based versions. Some of them have been used
in production for years now. I sometimes wonder if staying with &lt;code&gt;0.&lt;/code&gt; is
unprofessional and I should just release 1.0 and be done with it or if it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I evaluate software packages more often than not I don&amp;rsquo;t look at the version
number or the version numbering scheme (except when a package is still using
&lt;code&gt;0.0.&lt;/code&gt;) when deciding whether to rely on it or not. The documentation and the
code itself are much more important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t uploaded any releases in the last 14 days. That&amp;rsquo;s good: I&amp;rsquo;m one of
those people who have made their passion their job (which is great) but that
sometimes makes it hard to not work at all since I can always tell myself that
I&amp;rsquo;m not working, that it&amp;rsquo;s just a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 40)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-40/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-40/</id><published>2023-10-04T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-10-04T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 40)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More work on hosting several websites from a single Django application server using feincms3-sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned feincms3-sites last week in my last weeknotes entry; I have
again given this package a lot of attention in the last days, so another update
is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to override the list of languages available on each site.
That&amp;rsquo;s especially useful for an upcoming campaign site where the umbrella
group&amp;rsquo;s site is available in three languages, but (most?) individual group
sites (hosted on subdomains) will only have a subset of languages. Since I live
in a country with four national languages (english isn&amp;rsquo;t one of them, but is
spoken by many!) supporting more than one language, or even many languages is
totally commonplace. It&amp;rsquo;s great that Django has good support for
internationalization. For the sake of an example, I have the following sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;: The default. The host has to match exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;subdomain.example.com&lt;/code&gt;: One individual group&amp;rsquo;s site. The host has to match the regex &lt;code&gt;^subdomain\.&lt;/code&gt; (sorry, I actually do like regexes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overriding configured hosts for local development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which always annoyed me when using &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.sites&lt;/code&gt; was that
&amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; pulling the database from production to the local development
environment always produced links pointing back to the remote host instead of
working locally (when producing absolute URLs). This problem was shared by
feincms3-sites as well. I have now found a very ugly but perfectly workable
solution: Overwrite &lt;code&gt;Site.get_host()&lt;/code&gt; locally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;example.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Or whatever&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8000&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;FEINCMS3_SITES_SITE_GET_HOST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works especially well when using &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; and maybe subdomains of
&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;: All absolute links will point to &lt;code&gt;localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;subdomain.localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;*.localhost&lt;/code&gt; always resolves to the local IP
the browser knows where it should connect to, and since
&lt;code&gt;subdomain.localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt; also matches the &lt;code&gt;^subdomain\.&lt;/code&gt; regex mentioned
above, the site selection logic works as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if you have more domains, not just subdomains, you could adapt the
&lt;code&gt;get_host&lt;/code&gt; override and the relevant regexes to those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re at 100% code coverage now when running the test suite. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging into the Django admin using your Google account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This functionality has long been provided by
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-admin-sso&lt;/a&gt;; however, as
mentioned a long time ago this package still uses a deprecated OAuth2 library.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt; supports using a
Google account to authenticate with the Django admin since 2017. I have now
fixed a small problem with it: If you are logged into a single Google account,
and this account&amp;rsquo;s email address doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the configured admin login rule,
you were out of luck: There was no way to add another account at that time
because the library didn&amp;rsquo;t request the account selection. That has changed now,
if the first login attempt doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, it now explicitly tells Google to let
the user select their Google account. A small quality of life improvement for
those using more than one Google account (voluntarily or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.4.3&lt;/a&gt;: Polished the CKEditor integration a little bit. Re-enabled the source button now that we&amp;rsquo;re back to using the classic iframe-based editor again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.19.3&lt;/a&gt;: See above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.16.4&lt;/a&gt;: See above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 39)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-39/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-39/</id><published>2023-09-28T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-09-28T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 39)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again a few weeks have passed since the last weeknotes entry :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving feincms3 repositories into the feincms organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms"&gt;feincms&lt;/a&gt; GitHub organization has seen more
active days when FeinCMS 1.x was still actively developed. Since my interest
has moved to feincms3 some years ago I haven&amp;rsquo;t kept the organization up to
date. That has changed this week, and I have moved most feincms3-related
repositories into the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much though, but it certainly feels more official now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding scheduled tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started using the cronjob schedule feature of GitHub actions to ensure that tests run at least once a month in a few important projects. I want to get notified of changes in Django@main affecting my packages not only when actively working on them. I try to keep up with Django@main in all packages I maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.18.2&lt;/a&gt;: Many releases in the last weeks. Stopped using permanent redirects in DEBUG mode. Avoid migrations when Django adds more languages. Added utilities which allow restricting model relations to objects in the same site (trickier than it sounds). Added utilities for building full URLs to other sites without taxing the database as much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/"&gt;feincms3-language-sites 0.2.0&lt;/a&gt;: No biggie. No permanent redirects in DEBUG mode anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.4.5&lt;/a&gt;: Reduced the byte size of the CSS and JavaScript some more. Added spanish translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.16.3&lt;/a&gt;: I have published a post last week describing the new &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/"&gt;role-based permissions feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-imagefield/"&gt;django-imagefield 0.17&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;process_imagefields&lt;/code&gt; management command now allows specifying globs. If you wanted to prerender all imagefields in the pages app you can use &lt;code&gt;./manage.py process_imagefields pages.*&lt;/code&gt; now instead of listing all image fields&amp;rsquo; labels explicitly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.4.1&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m enormously unhappy but I had to go back to the classic CKEditor instead of using the inline editor. The latter looked much nicer but overriding the Django admin CSS was very very painful. Also, I can totally understand why CKEditor 5 is completely different and why CKEditor 4 is only maintained in a paid LTS plan. It still is making me look for alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-mptt/"&gt;django-mptt 0.15&lt;/a&gt;: I unfortunately am still using this despite the fact that I have marked it as officially unmaintained since march 2021. I did a mediocre job of making the library run on Django@main again. Parts of the library do not work, but since I&amp;rsquo;m not using them I don&amp;rsquo;t care too much. I&amp;rsquo;m still wondering if someone wants to take over maintenance of the library since it still seems to be actively used in projects of others as well. When I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use django-mptt I&amp;rsquo;m still really happy with &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/django-tree-queries/"&gt;django-tree-queries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/form-designer/"&gt;form-designer 0.22&lt;/a&gt;: This is probably my oldest actively developed project these days. 13 years! (Except for django-content-editor of course.) I have modernized the package, switched to hatchling and put out a new release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 33)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-33/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-33/</id><published>2023-08-20T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-08-20T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 33)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should call these posts weeknotes when I see the posting schedule, but oh well. Keep expectations up but also practice forgiveness when not meeting them, it&amp;rsquo;s fine really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;py_modules&lt;/code&gt; using hatchling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I converted &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/speckenv/"&gt;speckenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-sitemaps/"&gt;django-sitemaps&lt;/a&gt; after finding the following very helpful post on packaging projects consisting of Python modules without any packages: &lt;a href="https://www.stefaanlippens.net/single-python-module-packaging-hatch.html"&gt;Packaging of single Python module projects with Hatch/Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy in hindsight, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant part is including the files in the build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[tool.hatch.build]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv_django.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv_django_patch.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar and tracing the cause of DB queries in an async world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also started investigating what would have to be changed in django-debug-toolbar to make it fully support async Django. We currently patch Django&amp;rsquo;s database cursors per thread, which works fine in sync Django land to attribute SQL queries to a particular request/response cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since async Django executes DB queries in a thread pool executor and the rest of the work happens inside awaitables (async land) I don&amp;rsquo;t immediately see a way how we could do the same thing. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible to find out which task spawned another task (without dropping down to C?) but maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m overlooking. I hope that someone smarter than me finds a way :-) or that I find the time and motivation to either find a way using Python or using C/Rust/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.16&lt;/a&gt;: I added basic support for &lt;code&gt;i18n_patterns&lt;/code&gt; when using feincms3-sites with its &lt;code&gt;default_language_middleware&lt;/code&gt; (which allows setting a default language per site in case there is no other mechanism overriding it, such as &lt;code&gt;i18n_patterns&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.4.1&lt;/a&gt;: The privacy policy is now linked inside the banner text instead of adding a link after the text. Looks much nicer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="lhttps://pypi.org/project/speckenv/"&gt;speckenv 5.0&lt;/a&gt;: Finally released changes made a long time ago which make one edge case when parsing settings less surprising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.2&lt;/a&gt;: I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much work here again, mostly code reviews, some changes to the ruff configuration and general polishing. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t do the release itself, that was handled by Tim. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/FeinCMS/"&gt;FeinCMS 23.8&lt;/a&gt;: Fixes for Pillow 10, and some feincms3 / django-content-editor interoperability improvements which make it easier to reuse plugins/content types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.1&lt;/a&gt;: Some basic support for using the apps middleware with async Django. Not documented yet and not deployed anywhere but it basically works. Some documentation edits and changes to the inline CKEditor styling because of the recent changes to Django admin&amp;rsquo;s CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 30)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-30/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-30/</id><published>2023-07-28T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Async Django&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Django Channels&lt;/a&gt; successfully in a few projects from 2017 to 2019. A few months back I have worked with &lt;a href="https://www.starlette.io/"&gt;Starlette&lt;/a&gt;. And now I have finally started digging into using Django itself with an ASGI server, and not just for one or two views but also including the middleware stack etc since I also need authentication, not just an endpoint forwarding requests to a remote server. I have looked at &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian"&gt;Granian&lt;/a&gt;, an RSGI/ASGI server written in Rust. But for now I am using &lt;a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/"&gt;uvicorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django truly has come a long way but there&amp;rsquo;s much left to do. Django 5.0 is looking great already, but 4.2 misses many pieces still. I am really really glad Django wants to stay backwards compatible but I wish I could wave a magic wand and upgrade everything to async. Adding &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; prefixes everywhere for the async version is certainly a good compromise and probably the way to go but it&amp;rsquo;s just not that nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with making &lt;a href="https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s applications middleware async compatible because I want the full middleware stack to be async. The code is already released but undocumented and not even mentioned in the changelog. So, feel free to play around with it but it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be stable or supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.1&lt;/a&gt;: Switched to hatchling and ruff. Updated the feincms3-sites docs. Some async updates mentioned above. A Django 4.2 admin CSS update for the inline CKEditor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-forms/"&gt;feincms3-forms 0.4&lt;/a&gt;: Switched to hatchling and ruff. Started defining default icons for the form fields &lt;a href="https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/"&gt;content editor&lt;/a&gt; plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-ckeditor/"&gt;django-ckeditor 6.7&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m still maintaining the CKEditor 4 integration for Django even though CKEditor 4 itself isn&amp;rsquo;t supported anymore. Minor updates to the editor itself and Pillow compatibility updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.3.2&lt;/a&gt;: The cookie banner doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate an empty &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="f3cc"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element anymore if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to add inside (e.g. if the user only accepted necessary cookies).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mainly done work in private projects this week. Not much to talk about.
Except for the ZIP file &lt;code&gt;content-type&lt;/code&gt; bug which was interesting enough to
justify &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/serving-zip-files-using-django/"&gt;its own blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-cabinet/"&gt;django-cabinet 0.13&lt;/a&gt;: I converted
  the package to use ruff, hatchling; started running CI tests using Python
  3.11. The internals of the Django admin&amp;rsquo;s filters have changed to allow
  multi-valued filters, this has required some changes to the implementation of
  the folder filter. I opted to using a relatively ugly &lt;code&gt;django.VERSION&lt;/code&gt;
  hack; but that&amp;rsquo;s not too bad since such branches will be automatically
  removed by the awesome
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade"&gt;django-upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. I would have
  tried finding other ways in the past but now that old compatibility code can
  be removed by a single run of &lt;code&gt;django-upgrade&lt;/code&gt; (respectively
  &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;) there really is no point to doing it in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 28)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-28/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-28/</id><published>2023-07-12T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-12T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 28)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/"&gt;html-sanitizer 2.2&lt;/a&gt;: Made the
  sanitizer&amp;rsquo;s configuration initialization more strict. Strings cannot be used
  anymore in places where the sanitizer expects a set (resp. any iterable).
  It&amp;rsquo;s useful that strings are iterable in Python and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to change
  that, but the fact that &lt;code&gt;("class")&lt;/code&gt; is a string and not a tuple makes me sad.
  The fact that tuples are created by &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and not by &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; will always trip up
  people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/"&gt;feincms3-language-sites
  0.1&lt;/a&gt;: The version number
  is wrong but whatever. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly happy with the state of things. The big
  change in 0.1 is that &lt;code&gt;Page.get_absolute_url&lt;/code&gt; no longer generates
  protocol-relative URLs. Depending on the value of &lt;code&gt;SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; it
  automatically prepends either &lt;code&gt;http:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.15&lt;/a&gt;:
  django-authlib&amp;rsquo;s admin Single Sign On module now supports a hook to
  automatically create staff users when a matching user doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist already.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to use this functionality myself and I have recommended people
  to implement the functionality themselves using the tools in django-authlib
  if they need it, but the change was so small and well-contained that adding
  it to the core made sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipx inject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that &lt;a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/"&gt;pipx&lt;/a&gt; seems to remember injected
packages even across &lt;code&gt;pipx reinstall&lt;/code&gt; invocations. Not too surprising now that
we know it, but we certainly spent some time scratching our heads. &lt;code&gt;pipx
uninject&lt;/code&gt; was the thing we needed to stop pipx from installing an old version
of a dependency instead of the one being specified in &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;hatchling and data files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very confused by the way &lt;a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/"&gt;hatchling&lt;/a&gt; sometimes
includes data files and sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I had to add &lt;code&gt;[tool.hatch.build]
include=["authlib/"]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/commit/67d4673e4039eac277b5d2557c0736c1f01442ac"&gt;django-authlib&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;
file&lt;/a&gt;
to make it include HTML files from subpackages. Maybe the subpackages are the
reason, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Payment providers that must not be named&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent hours and hours battling with the badly documented, incomplete,
inconsistent and confusing API of a (not that well known) payment provider
based in Switzerland. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that this still happens years and years
after Stripe started offering a really well thought out and documented API
geared towards programmers. It&amp;rsquo;s really sad because when the same structure is
named with differing naming conventions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;snake_case&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;camelCase&lt;/code&gt;) in
different parts of the API you just know that somebody spent too much time
writing too much code instead of reusing already existing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 26)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-26/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-26/</id><published>2023-06-30T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-06-30T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 26)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I released updates to a few of my packages; I have continued converting packages to &lt;a href="https://hatch.pypa.io"&gt;hatchling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt; while doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New releases in the last two weeks include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tree-queries/"&gt;django-tree-queries 0.15&lt;/a&gt;: Added a new function, &lt;code&gt;.without_tree_fields()&lt;/code&gt; to the queryset which can be used to avoid the &lt;code&gt;.with_tree_fields(False)&lt;/code&gt; boolean trap warning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.3.1&lt;/a&gt;: This small update allows replacing the feincms3 &lt;a href="https://noembed.com"&gt;noembed.com&lt;/a&gt; oEmbed code using other libraries such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/coleifer/micawber/"&gt;micawber&lt;/a&gt; which support a wider range of URLs while still gating the embed behind users&amp;rsquo; explicit consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-downloads/"&gt;feincms3-downloads 0.5.3&lt;/a&gt;: Updated translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-ckeditor/"&gt;django-ckeditor 6.6.1&lt;/a&gt;: Updated the bundled CKEditor 4 and merged a pull request adding better integration with Django admin&amp;rsquo;s dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/"&gt;django-js-asset 2.1&lt;/a&gt;: Just basic maintainability and packaging updates. The &lt;code&gt;JS()&lt;/code&gt; implementation itself is untouched since February 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/"&gt;html-sanitizer 2.0&lt;/a&gt;: Not really a backwards incompatible change (at least not according to the tests); I just wanted to avoid &lt;code&gt;1.10&lt;/code&gt; and go directly to &lt;code&gt;2.0&lt;/code&gt; this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using GitHub project boards more and more. It definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t the most versatile way of managing projects but it sort-of hits the sweet spot for us. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly happy with it, and it seems to me that applying &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power"&gt;the rule of least power&lt;/a&gt; to project management software may not be such a bad idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built-in workflows are a bit boring and limited; especially the fact that it seems impossible to automatically add issues to the project when using multiple repositories. Luckily, &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/add-to-project"&gt;actions/add-to-project&lt;/a&gt; exists so that&amp;rsquo;s not really a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To cloud or not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a long discussion with a colleague about containerization, Kubernetes, self-hosting, etc. etc. and I still don&amp;rsquo;t know where I stand. I can honestly say that the old way of hosting (ca. 2010) still works fine. I worry about the deterioriation of service quality we&amp;rsquo;re seeing and sometimes I really would like to have root to apply quick fixes where now I have to jump to hoops just to get what I already know I need. Annoying. But migrations are annoying as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduled publishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I augmented the script generating this website with scheduled publishing support while again reducing the number of lines in the file. The code is still formatted using black and ruff, while only ignoring line-length errors (I do this everywhere now to avoid breaking up long strings, not to put much code onto single lines) and allowing named lambdas. The weeknotes from two weeks ago where published by GitHub actions&amp;rsquo; cron scheduling support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I like programming more than writing (even though I like writing)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that writing is the first thing I start skipping when I have to
prioritize. Programming, biking, gardening come first. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, really. But
I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit sad that I do not manage to at least put out a short weekly
weeknotes entry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 24)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-24/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-24/</id><published>2023-06-16T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-06-16T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 24)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life happened and I missed a month of weeknotes. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have released &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;django-debug-toolbar
4.1&lt;/a&gt;. Another cycle where I
mostly contributed reviews and not much else. Feels great :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going all in on hatch and hatchling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know hatch because django-debug-toolbar was converted to it. I was
confused as probably anyone else with the new state of packaging in Python
world. After listening to a few Podcasts (for example &lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow"&gt;Hatch: A Modern Python
Workflow&lt;/a&gt;)
I did bite the bullet and started converting projects to hatch as mentioned
&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-13-and-14/"&gt;some time ago&lt;/a&gt;. I have
converted a few other projects in the meantime because the development
experience is nicer. Not much, but enough to make it worthwile.
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites&lt;/a&gt; is the latest
package I converted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CKEditor 5&amp;rsquo;s new license and django-ckeditor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure is on to maybe switch away from CKEditor 4 since it probably will not be supported after &lt;a href="https://support.ckeditor.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005281629-How-long-will-CKEditor-4-be-supported-"&gt;June 2023&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s totally understandable that the CKEditor 5 license isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as before, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that means for the Django integration &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/issues/482"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining since a few years. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like the new capabilities of CKEditor all that much and don&amp;rsquo;t intend to use them; maybe it would be better to use a build of &lt;a href=""&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; in the CMS since &lt;a href="https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#about-rich-text-editors"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re intentionally only using a very small subset of the features most rich text editors offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mountain biking.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mountain bike is repaired, I&amp;rsquo;m back on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 18 and 19)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-18-and-19/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-18-and-19/</id><published>2023-05-12T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-05-12T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 18 and 19)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much programming this week :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/"&gt;Still occupying myself with oEmbed.&lt;/a&gt; I have been looking at a few libraries and have rediscovered &lt;a href="https://github.com/coleifer/micawber/"&gt;micawber&lt;/a&gt; which probably does everything I need. Yay, another reinvented wheel avoided. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it yet but I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that replacing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/feincms3/plugins/external.py"&gt;oEmbed functionality in feincms3&amp;rsquo;s external plugin&lt;/a&gt; with micawber would be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vacation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacation last week. Was nice. We went for a few hikes. I have learned that I&amp;rsquo;m
not totally free from giddiness anymore. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 17)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/</id><published>2023-04-28T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-28T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 17)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Birthday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year achieved. Feels the same as last year. I&amp;rsquo;m glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have released &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol
1.3&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly cleanups since
1.2, but also a new translation (already announced here). The script size has
been reduced from 4519 bytes to 4228 bytes (-6.5%) while keeping all features
intact. The reduction is totally meaningless but it was fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been digging into the oEmbed spec a bit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that a
central list of &lt;a href="https://oembed.com/providers.json"&gt;providers&lt;/a&gt; exists.
&lt;a href="https://noembed.com/"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; still works great to embed many different types
of content but I worry more and more about its maintenance state.
Reimplementing the interesting parts shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, but maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to do this myself. &lt;a href="https://github.com/attakei-lab/oEmbedPy/"&gt;oEmbedPy&lt;/a&gt;
looks nice, I hope I get a chance to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 16)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-16/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-16/</id><published>2023-04-21T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-21T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 16)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiments with Stable Diffusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend and myself threw a few scripts together to automatically finetune a Stable Diffusion model using images downloaded from Google Image search. It&amp;rsquo;s terrifying how easy and fast generating fake news including photorealistic images can be and will be already. And seeing how fast those models improve it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of time until we can trust photos even less than now. Manipulating images has been possible for a long time of course, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a &amp;ldquo;commodity&amp;rdquo; until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely also see upsides in the new machine learning technologies but I fear that there&amp;rsquo;s a real danger to trust, and in extension to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology and what we did will be a part of an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/sendung/kulturplatz?id=d70e9bb9-0cee-46b6-8d87-7cbd8317a9c7"&gt;SRF Kulturplatz&lt;/a&gt; broadcast, or so I hope. It&amp;rsquo;s high time that the public knows what&amp;rsquo;s possible. It&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;strong&gt;,edia literacy&lt;/strong&gt; really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not that pessimistic though. I just hope that this time the thoughtfulness will prevail over pure profit seeking. (Did I really write that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are noticing that the CKEditor 4 integration for Django doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that well when using the dark color scheme of the Django admin panel. That&amp;rsquo;s not surprising. What does surprise me is the number of reports and the total absence of pull requests. Subjectively, most other packages I help maintain have a comfortable ratio of issues and pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining and people aren&amp;rsquo;t complaining, almost everyone is nice and tries to be helpful. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a heavy user of django-ckeditor anymore I don&amp;rsquo;t really find the motivation to fix this issue myself since it&amp;rsquo;s not all that enjoyable work to me. I would just hope that &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/issues/670"&gt;after all this time&lt;/a&gt; someone would finally come and do the necessary work &amp;ndash; if they cared enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-mptt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have marked &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt"&gt;django-mptt&lt;/a&gt; as unmaintained two years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m still looking at pull requests from time to time but without feeling an obligation to do so and without feeling bad when I miss something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there are still many people out there who still depend on this library and if any of them would be willing to pick up the maintenance? On the off chance that someone is out there who has the time, ability and motivation and just didn&amp;rsquo;t know that django-mptt could use some love: Here&amp;rsquo;s your invite!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 15)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-15/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-15/</id><published>2023-04-16T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-16T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 15)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Romansh translations for feincms3-cookiecontrol and django-fineforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feincms3 cookie control banner and django-fineforms have received a small update: Support for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language"&gt;Romansh&lt;/a&gt; language. I would be surprised if any readers of this blog even knew about this language at all. Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian and the mentioned Romansh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence of course that those two packages have received an update at the same time. Both packages are used for an upcoming campaign site where people may express their support for political action to preserve or protect the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s at the same time laughable and horrifying that this is even a thing though: Who in their right mind could NOT agree that preserving biodiversity is important? It&amp;rsquo;s incomprehensible. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a romantic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmensch"&gt;Gutmensch&lt;/a&gt; after all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set up the &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/stale"&gt;stale&lt;/a&gt; GitHub action for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt; repository. So many support requests, so little time and almost no actual collaborators. Also, many support requests actually concern CKEditor itself, not its Django integration. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t complain though, CKEditor has served me well and still does, &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/feincms3/inline_ckeditor.py"&gt;especially when it&amp;rsquo;s being used with a very minimal configuration&lt;/a&gt; which basically makes most pain points of HTML editors go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reviewed and merged a few changes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar"&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/a&gt; in the last week. Still a fun project, especially since it&amp;rsquo;s so widely used and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My son will be a teenager soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eldest is now 12 years old and will be a teenager soon. We had a good time and two nice Birthday parties, one with his friends and one with family and our friends. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/apr/03/django-42-released/"&gt;Django 4.2 was released&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/762"&gt;Hatch gained support for the Django 4.2 Trove classifier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;we released django-debug-toolbar 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, with support for Django 4.2, psycopg 3 and all the existing goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/a&gt; has gained support for consciously embedding stuff via oEmbed. It can now use &lt;a href="https://noembed.com/"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s external plugin) and only actually embed the third party content if users consented explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since learned through the &lt;a href="https://podcast.datenschutzpartner.ch/"&gt;Datenschutz-Plaudereien&lt;/a&gt; podcast that laws regarding consent are not that strict in Switzerland compared to the European Union, also not when the &lt;a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-90134.html"&gt;DSG&lt;/a&gt; is put into effect in September. What&amp;rsquo;s right and what&amp;rsquo;s legal are two different things and while I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the ubiquitous cookie banners (especially not when they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually doing anything) I like the idea of explicit consent and of not sending data unnecessarily to third party providers. The additional click isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diving into hatch for Python packaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the TalkPython podcast episode with Ofek Lev on &lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow"&gt;his Hatch packaging tool&lt;/a&gt;. After a long period of uncertainty and waiting I bit the bullet and started to migrate a few of my Python packages from setuptools and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; to hatch and &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;, until now &lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;. It was surprisingly painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ruff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning Rust during the last &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;; it&amp;rsquo;s a nice language. &lt;a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt; is a linter and (more and more) formatter for Python code written in Rust. After years of working with Python and Python-based tools it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly fast, almost worryingly so. It&amp;rsquo;s true what they say: ruff finishes so fast that I&amp;rsquo;m always left wondering if it even did anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m configuring ruff through &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;, so switching from setuptools to hatch (see above) also helped in this regard. The main trouble I had was that I&amp;rsquo;m running Python 3.11 locally but Python 3.10 in the server environment (no dev-prod parity&amp;hellip;), and rebuilding &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; locally of course didn&amp;rsquo;t add TOML support because it&amp;rsquo;s built into Python 3.11, but Python 3.10 needs an external package. So of course I broke the build. That&amp;rsquo;s not all bad though: If stuff broke it definitely helps with remembering the reasons later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-writing still works really well for me. Expressed differently: I seem to be unable to write without the (slight) pressure of writing together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 11 and 12)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-11-and-12/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-11-and-12/</id><published>2023-03-24T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-24T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 11 and 12)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mail user agents being mail user agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt; is my collection of utilities for implementing passwordless authentication, either using OAuth2 or by sending magic links by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter functionality has existed for a long time in &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-registration/"&gt;django-registration&lt;/a&gt; (which is great!) but I wanted a way to generate links without the need for a storage somewhere. Django has utilities for &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/signing/"&gt;Cryptographic signing&lt;/a&gt; built-in as the &lt;code&gt;django.core.signing&lt;/code&gt; module. I&amp;rsquo;m using this module to send a signed version of the email address to users, and when I&amp;rsquo;m able to successfully verify the email addresses signature I can be sure (enough) that those links have actually been generated by my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form of the generated verification URL is as follows: &lt;code&gt;https://example.com/.../test@example.com:1pXJtx:aypKOlb5zaCg.../&lt;/code&gt;; the part before the first colon contains the data-to-be-verified, the short string between colons is the timestamp and the rest is the signature, everything generated by &lt;code&gt;django.core.signing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then mail user agents happened. Some MUAs insist to butcher the URL in various ways, e.g. by removing the signature or by making only the embedded email address clickable. This is &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; behavior and certainly unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I implemented a change where I&amp;rsquo;m now also base64 encoding the email address itself. So, the URL is even longer and even more opaque now but it seems to work well. I also added a HTML version of the mail to hopefully prevent mail programs from creating their own worse version. I could have done that a long time ago but I really like &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; mails so I did hold off on that as long as I could. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-data and unique fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a longer post on &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/moving-data-including-deletions-between-the-same-django-app-running-in-different-environments/"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt; some time ago which explains what it is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring problem was dumping and loading data in the presence of unique constraints. For example, website managers deleted data with a specific (unique) slug and created new data with the same slug. feincms3-data and also Django itself were unable to handle this. The former because it loads new data before deleting old data, the latter because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a concept of data which should be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feincms3-data now has an ugly workaround for this problem: It generates random data for a list of explicitly specified fields (which is very unlikely to cause collisions) and only updates the records with the correct data after the cleanup step. &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data/commit/9324605dc8dcb32ee4118adca0668643597ec130"&gt;The code wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hairy to write&lt;/a&gt; and I was again very happy that unittesting is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ProseMirror hacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back to hacking on &lt;a href="https://prosemirror.net/"&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; plugins. I still feel really well about picking it as a basis for all those use cases when using the venerable &lt;a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/"&gt;CKEditor 4&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did like the fact a lot that ProseMirror was written in JavaScript. Now that it has been rewritten in TypeScript I&amp;rsquo;m reevaluating my resistance against TypeScript, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Why write down all those annotations when the code also works without? I still don&amp;rsquo;t really see the point. Yes I know, catching bugs early and all that. But still.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 10)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-10/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-10/</id><published>2023-03-10T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-10T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 10)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FeinCMS bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms/"&gt;FeinCMS&lt;/a&gt; is really stable (since there isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on) but this week a Django upgrade surfaced bugs in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms/blob/main/feincms/extensions/datepublisher.py"&gt;datepublisher&lt;/a&gt; extension. The extension uses a &lt;code&gt;granular_now&lt;/code&gt; utility to determine if a page should be shown or not; the time is rounded to a 5-minute boundary which makes some sorts of caching more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad that activity on the project has practically ground to a halt, on the other hand it&amp;rsquo;s great that the project requires practically no changes when a new version of Django is released. Stability is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15 years of using GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://subversion.apache.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://darcs.net/"&gt;darcs&lt;/a&gt; for probably not much more than a year each before discovering &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; probably some time in spring 2006. It was a very archaic version with a much worse CLI than today. Everything was archaic, not just the CLI itself but also the repository browsers and the various web UIs. But everything was also very interesting to me. I especially found the emphasis on clean data structures instead of code very inspiring. And here we are, basically all the tools have been rewritten but the commits from back then are still around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marks the 15 anniversary of my GitHub account. I was invited to join the private beta. GitHub was probably the first Git-related tool I encountered which actually looked nice. Hard to believe that so much time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(No, I don&amp;rsquo;t find Git hard to use. And I have basically stopped losing work since I started using Git, something which has happened too often before.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static Site generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around with several static site generators to replace my blogging software. I checked out several generators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting because it uses Python and Jinja2 which should make it easier to reuse the Django templates (or so I thought)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; seems to be very widely used and looks like a good idea to bet on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site runs on Django and I&amp;rsquo;m using a markdown editor based on &lt;a href="https://codemirror.net/"&gt;CodeMirror&lt;/a&gt; in the admin. I do like CodeMirror a lot but I would like it even more if I could use neovim in the console. I know that vim bindings for CodeMirror exist, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good experience with the vim bindings for VisualStudio Code so I&amp;rsquo;m wary (and too lazy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with all those generators are that they have different ideas for how to structure the URLs and RSS/Atom feeds. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514113830/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id"&gt;I have since learned the reason why Pelican doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the permalink of posts as their Atom ID&lt;/a&gt; (from the &lt;code&gt;feedgenerator&lt;/code&gt; module) but I&amp;rsquo;m just not convinced that flooding aggregators with old posts is a net benefit to everyone. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s only once but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;m now thinking about writing my own static site generator, for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks, Tim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been coworking with &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@CodenameTim@fosstodon.org/109807763335807167"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; to write more. Tim and I have been maintaining the &lt;a href="https://jazzband.co/projects/django-debug-toolbar"&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/a&gt; together in the last few years and have been pairing up every one or two weeks to write together (mostly) in silence as described by &lt;a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/mar/9/coworking-to-write-more/"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss in his blog entry&lt;/a&gt; a few times. Today I really needed the additional motivation brought by committing to work together. If not for this arrangement I would probably have skipped it and who knows if I had managed to restart the weeknotes streak next week on my own&amp;hellip;!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 8 and 9)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-8-and-9/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-8-and-9/</id><published>2023-03-03T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-03T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 8 and 9)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was a short work week. We spent a few nights in the mountains. Not much snow though. Enough for some skiing and sledging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work week was &amp;hellip; not normal. Many meetings, not enough time to work on projects. That shortens these week notes a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Django Software Foundation membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out through Tim that I have been &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/2023/jan/12/dsf-board-monthly-meeting/"&gt;approved as an individual member of the Django Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m honored and hope that this will be another way where I can give something back. It also feels good to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/"&gt;meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt; were public. I still use RSS and can wholeheartedly recommend &lt;a href="https://theoldreader.com/"&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt; (no affiliation) and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try adding a RSS feed of meeting minutes to the website. &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/pull/1316"&gt;The pull request is still being reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-forms documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-forms"&gt;feincms3-forms&lt;/a&gt; README a bit. The README hopefully clarifies the purpose and the components of the app a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely flexible forms builder for the Django admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Migrating from Bitbucket to GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a long time Bitbucket user since GitHub used a pricing where many private repositories were very expensive and Bitbucket only charged a fee per user. This has changed long ago though. I wanted to consolidate the tools used at $work and have therefore taken the time to move all private repositores to GitHub. Determining the list of repositories in a Bitbucket Workspace was surprisingly annoying but I got there in the end with an app-specific password and curl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I converted the JSON into a list of Git/SSH cloning URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;links&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;clone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ssh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;values&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used it as (I had to repeat the first command for every 100 repos):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; do (cd mirror; git clone --mirror $url) ; done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I wrote another Python script to create the repositores and upload them all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;repo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;gh repo create --private feinheit-archive/{repo[:-4]}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cd {repo} &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push git@github.com:feinheit-archive/{repo[:-4]}.git --all&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;rm -rf {repo}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ran ist as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mirror&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough I learned that GitHub ratelimits repository creation. So I had to wait an hour after several dozen repos and start the command again afterwards. Of course the code wasn&amp;rsquo;t written defensively at first and deleted repos which weren&amp;rsquo;t uploaded yet so I had to work out the set of repos I have to re-download from Bitbucket&amp;hellip; I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit surprising that &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t raise an exception by default when a command fails. &lt;code&gt;check=True&lt;/code&gt; should definitely be the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not posting the code because I&amp;rsquo;m proud but because I&amp;rsquo;m not. Throwing such stuff together with Python feels great, and using &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run(..., shell=True)&lt;/code&gt; is more fun than writing bash scripts with &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Frontend frameworks to kickstart your site and to drag you down later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer blog post is in the making as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to formulate my thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend frameworks are a great help in getting a product out of the door quickly. But tools and needs evolve. Backwards incompatible versions&lt;sup id="fnref:semver"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:semver"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of those Frameworks are published. And then it happens: Too many things break at once and you have to pick up the pieces. What has been an advantage in the beginning drags you down, because now you have to maintain not just your own code but also everything you used from $framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had been (even 😂) more cautious when selecting tools for potentially long running projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:semver"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stuff breaks even when updating patch versions.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:semver" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;iOS and Kiosk mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research on easy ways to put an iPad into Kiosk mode because I want to build a surveying app for an exposition. The web platform is perfect for this especially given the budget constraints&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;a href="https://www.hexnode.com/blogs/what-is-ios-kiosk-mode/"&gt;What is iOS kiosk mode and how do I enable it?&lt;/a&gt; was a great overview over the available options for using iPads in Kiosk mode. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to build an app myself even though this would be relatively straightforward e.g. with React Native&lt;sup id="fnref:rn"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rn"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen"&gt;MDN Foxes example&lt;/a&gt; worked nicely apart from the fact that the bar containing the clock and indicators is still shown. This is probably an acceptable trade off, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitbucket to GitHub migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally managed to bump against the GitHub API&amp;rsquo;s rate limit. I have transferred more than 300 private Git repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub. Most repositories aren&amp;rsquo;t used actively anymore, so it&amp;rsquo;s not really about GitHub vs. Bitbucket. The goal was simply to have one less tool to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading the list of all repositores in a workspace was surprisingly annoying and I spent too much time bumping my head against the API authentication. In the end all I had to do was to generate an app specific password and authenticate with that and with my own username. It&amp;rsquo;s funny to me how simple things like that are still hard after working more than 15 years in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off by ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still progressing with learning &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; puzzles. Last night I was really close to a working solution but then I spent a lot of time chasing down off by one errors. I was totally aware that I should pay attention when writing the loop (respectively the range) and I still failed. Oh well, in the end it worked and I still had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do stolen bikes go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has probably seen that one already but I thought it was a really interesting study:
&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/where-do-stolen-bikes-go-0215"&gt;Where do stolen bikes go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also charted the movement of the bikes. Out of the 70 stolen bikes, 68 remained in the local Amsterdam area. Between three and six of those spent enough time in the vicinity of second-hand bike stores that the researchers concluded they were probably sold there. Another 12 bikes were taken to locations identified as places where bicycles are known to be sold informally, on the bicycle black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-data/"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt;: I wrote about circular references last week; this week I got confirmation that the code works and so I released it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-admin-sso/"&gt;django-admin-sso&lt;/a&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a project I&amp;rsquo;m not really using anymore, but I&amp;rsquo;m still maintaining it when it&amp;rsquo;s not much work. Switch to &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s admin SSO support if you can since django-admin-sso still uses the deprecated oauth2client library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rn"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some experience with React Native. It&amp;rsquo;s great to get started and works surprisingly well for a long time. The problems arrive one you want to optimize the behavior on all platforms and screen sizes but that&amp;rsquo;s a hard problem, so maybe problems shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise anyone.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rn" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some progress learning Rust. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look up each character and function and am slowly getting a feel for the language, unwrapping and the borrow checker, so that&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it for now, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-data and data cycles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added support for loading data with cyclic dependencies to &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt;. This is useful e.g. when having Django models where you have a &lt;code&gt;ForeignKey("self")&lt;/code&gt; and you want to use feincms3-data to insert a new copy of some object and its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editing trees in the Django administration interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back to one of my favorite (not) activities which is making tree-shaped data editable in the Django administration panel. &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms"&gt;FeinCMS&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/"&gt;django-mptt&lt;/a&gt; augments the changelist with some drag drop behavior. There&amp;rsquo;s no undo functionality though so making errors is potentially really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt; uses a separate page for moving nodes around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m working on a &lt;a href="https://preactjs.com/"&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt;-based project which also doesn&amp;rsquo;t use drag drop but which also allows inserting nodes, not just moving nodes around. I doubt I can make it reusable enough to make it useful for feincms3 but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
