&lt;p&gt;Another year achieved. Feels the same as last year. I&amp;rsquo;m glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have released &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol
1.3&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly cleanups since
1.2, but also a new translation (already announced here). The script size has
been reduced from 4519 bytes to 4228 bytes (-6.5%) while keeping all features
intact. The reduction is totally meaningless but it was fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been digging into the oEmbed spec a bit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that a
central list of &lt;a href="https://oembed.com/providers.json"&gt;providers&lt;/a&gt; exists.
&lt;a href="https://noembed.com/"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; still works great to embed many different types
of content but I worry more and more about its maintenance state.
Reimplementing the interesting parts shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, but maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to do this myself. &lt;a href="https://github.com/attakei-lab/oEmbedPy/"&gt;oEmbedPy&lt;/a&gt;
looks nice, I hope I get a chance to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 16)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-16/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-16/</id><published>2023-04-21T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-21T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 16)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiments with Stable Diffusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend and myself threw a few scripts together to automatically finetune a Stable Diffusion model using images downloaded from Google Image search. It&amp;rsquo;s terrifying how easy and fast generating fake news including photorealistic images can be and will be already. And seeing how fast those models improve it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of time until we can trust photos even less than now. Manipulating images has been possible for a long time of course, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a &amp;ldquo;commodity&amp;rdquo; until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely also see upsides in the new machine learning technologies but I fear that there&amp;rsquo;s a real danger to trust, and in extension to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology and what we did will be a part of an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/sendung/kulturplatz?id=d70e9bb9-0cee-46b6-8d87-7cbd8317a9c7"&gt;SRF Kulturplatz&lt;/a&gt; broadcast, or so I hope. It&amp;rsquo;s high time that the public knows what&amp;rsquo;s possible. It&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;strong&gt;,edia literacy&lt;/strong&gt; really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not that pessimistic though. I just hope that this time the thoughtfulness will prevail over pure profit seeking. (Did I really write that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are noticing that the CKEditor 4 integration for Django doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that well when using the dark color scheme of the Django admin panel. That&amp;rsquo;s not surprising. What does surprise me is the number of reports and the total absence of pull requests. Subjectively, most other packages I help maintain have a comfortable ratio of issues and pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining and people aren&amp;rsquo;t complaining, almost everyone is nice and tries to be helpful. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a heavy user of django-ckeditor anymore I don&amp;rsquo;t really find the motivation to fix this issue myself since it&amp;rsquo;s not all that enjoyable work to me. I would just hope that &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/issues/670"&gt;after all this time&lt;/a&gt; someone would finally come and do the necessary work &amp;ndash; if they cared enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-mptt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have marked &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt"&gt;django-mptt&lt;/a&gt; as unmaintained two years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m still looking at pull requests from time to time but without feeling an obligation to do so and without feeling bad when I miss something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there are still many people out there who still depend on this library and if any of them would be willing to pick up the maintenance? On the off chance that someone is out there who has the time, ability and motivation and just didn&amp;rsquo;t know that django-mptt could use some love: Here&amp;rsquo;s your invite!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 15)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-15/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-15/</id><published>2023-04-16T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-16T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 15)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Romansh translations for feincms3-cookiecontrol and django-fineforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feincms3 cookie control banner and django-fineforms have received a small update: Support for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language"&gt;Romansh&lt;/a&gt; language. I would be surprised if any readers of this blog even knew about this language at all. Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian and the mentioned Romansh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence of course that those two packages have received an update at the same time. Both packages are used for an upcoming campaign site where people may express their support for political action to preserve or protect the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s at the same time laughable and horrifying that this is even a thing though: Who in their right mind could NOT agree that preserving biodiversity is important? It&amp;rsquo;s incomprehensible. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a romantic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmensch"&gt;Gutmensch&lt;/a&gt; after all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set up the &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/stale"&gt;stale&lt;/a&gt; GitHub action for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt; repository. So many support requests, so little time and almost no actual collaborators. Also, many support requests actually concern CKEditor itself, not its Django integration. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t complain though, CKEditor has served me well and still does, &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/feincms3/inline_ckeditor.py"&gt;especially when it&amp;rsquo;s being used with a very minimal configuration&lt;/a&gt; which basically makes most pain points of HTML editors go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reviewed and merged a few changes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar"&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/a&gt; in the last week. Still a fun project, especially since it&amp;rsquo;s so widely used and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging with vim is fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 13 and 14)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-13-and-14/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-13-and-14/</id><published>2023-04-05T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-05T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 13 and 14)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My son will be a teenager soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eldest is now 12 years old and will be a teenager soon. We had a good time and two nice Birthday parties, one with his friends and one with family and our friends. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/apr/03/django-42-released/"&gt;Django 4.2 was released&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/762"&gt;Hatch gained support for the Django 4.2 Trove classifier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;we released django-debug-toolbar 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, with support for Django 4.2, psycopg 3 and all the existing goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/a&gt; has gained support for consciously embedding stuff via oEmbed. It can now use &lt;a href="https://noembed.com/"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s external plugin) and only actually embed the third party content if users consented explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since learned through the &lt;a href="https://podcast.datenschutzpartner.ch/"&gt;Datenschutz-Plaudereien&lt;/a&gt; podcast that laws regarding consent are not that strict in Switzerland compared to the European Union, also not when the &lt;a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-90134.html"&gt;DSG&lt;/a&gt; is put into effect in September. What&amp;rsquo;s right and what&amp;rsquo;s legal are two different things and while I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the ubiquitous cookie banners (especially not when they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually doing anything) I like the idea of explicit consent and of not sending data unnecessarily to third party providers. The additional click isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diving into hatch for Python packaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the TalkPython podcast episode with Ofek Lev on &lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow"&gt;his Hatch packaging tool&lt;/a&gt;. After a long period of uncertainty and waiting I bit the bullet and started to migrate a few of my Python packages from setuptools and &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; to hatch and &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;, until now &lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;. It was surprisingly painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ruff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning Rust during the last &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;; it&amp;rsquo;s a nice language. &lt;a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt; is a linter and (more and more) formatter for Python code written in Rust. After years of working with Python and Python-based tools it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly fast, almost worryingly so. It&amp;rsquo;s true what they say: ruff finishes so fast that I&amp;rsquo;m always left wondering if it even did anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m configuring ruff through &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;, so switching from setuptools to hatch (see above) also helped in this regard. The main trouble I had was that I&amp;rsquo;m running Python 3.11 locally but Python 3.10 in the server environment (no dev-prod parity&amp;hellip;), and rebuilding &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; locally of course didn&amp;rsquo;t add TOML support because it&amp;rsquo;s built into Python 3.11, but Python 3.10 needs an external package. So of course I broke the build. That&amp;rsquo;s not all bad though: If stuff broke it definitely helps with remembering the reasons later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-writing still works really well for me. Expressed differently: I seem to be unable to write without the (slight) pressure of writing together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 11 and 12)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-11-and-12/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-11-and-12/</id><published>2023-03-24T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-24T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 11 and 12)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mail user agents being mail user agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt; is my collection of utilities for implementing passwordless authentication, either using OAuth2 or by sending magic links by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter functionality has existed for a long time in &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-registration/"&gt;django-registration&lt;/a&gt; (which is great!) but I wanted a way to generate links without the need for a storage somewhere. Django has utilities for &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/signing/"&gt;Cryptographic signing&lt;/a&gt; built-in as the &lt;code&gt;django.core.signing&lt;/code&gt; module. I&amp;rsquo;m using this module to send a signed version of the email address to users, and when I&amp;rsquo;m able to successfully verify the email addresses signature I can be sure (enough) that those links have actually been generated by my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form of the generated verification URL is as follows: &lt;code&gt;https://example.com/.../test@example.com:1pXJtx:aypKOlb5zaCg.../&lt;/code&gt;; the part before the first colon contains the data-to-be-verified, the short string between colons is the timestamp and the rest is the signature, everything generated by &lt;code&gt;django.core.signing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then mail user agents happened. Some MUAs insist to butcher the URL in various ways, e.g. by removing the signature or by making only the embedded email address clickable. This is &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; behavior and certainly unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I implemented a change where I&amp;rsquo;m now also base64 encoding the email address itself. So, the URL is even longer and even more opaque now but it seems to work well. I also added a HTML version of the mail to hopefully prevent mail programs from creating their own worse version. I could have done that a long time ago but I really like &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; mails so I did hold off on that as long as I could. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-data and unique fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a longer post on &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/moving-data-including-deletions-between-the-same-django-app-running-in-different-environments/"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt; some time ago which explains what it is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring problem was dumping and loading data in the presence of unique constraints. For example, website managers deleted data with a specific (unique) slug and created new data with the same slug. feincms3-data and also Django itself were unable to handle this. The former because it loads new data before deleting old data, the latter because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a concept of data which should be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feincms3-data now has an ugly workaround for this problem: It generates random data for a list of explicitly specified fields (which is very unlikely to cause collisions) and only updates the records with the correct data after the cleanup step. &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data/commit/9324605dc8dcb32ee4118adca0668643597ec130"&gt;The code wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hairy to write&lt;/a&gt; and I was again very happy that unittesting is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ProseMirror hacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back to hacking on &lt;a href="https://prosemirror.net/"&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; plugins. I still feel really well about picking it as a basis for all those use cases when using the venerable &lt;a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/"&gt;CKEditor 4&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did like the fact a lot that ProseMirror was written in JavaScript. Now that it has been rewritten in TypeScript I&amp;rsquo;m reevaluating my resistance against TypeScript, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Why write down all those annotations when the code also works without? I still don&amp;rsquo;t really see the point. Yes I know, catching bugs early and all that. But still.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 10)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-10/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-10/</id><published>2023-03-10T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-10T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 10)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FeinCMS bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms/"&gt;FeinCMS&lt;/a&gt; is really stable (since there isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on) but this week a Django upgrade surfaced bugs in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms/blob/main/feincms/extensions/datepublisher.py"&gt;datepublisher&lt;/a&gt; extension. The extension uses a &lt;code&gt;granular_now&lt;/code&gt; utility to determine if a page should be shown or not; the time is rounded to a 5-minute boundary which makes some sorts of caching more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad that activity on the project has practically ground to a halt, on the other hand it&amp;rsquo;s great that the project requires practically no changes when a new version of Django is released. Stability is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15 years of using GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://subversion.apache.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://darcs.net/"&gt;darcs&lt;/a&gt; for probably not much more than a year each before discovering &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; probably some time in spring 2006. It was a very archaic version with a much worse CLI than today. Everything was archaic, not just the CLI itself but also the repository browsers and the various web UIs. But everything was also very interesting to me. I especially found the emphasis on clean data structures instead of code very inspiring. And here we are, basically all the tools have been rewritten but the commits from back then are still around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marks the 15 anniversary of my GitHub account. I was invited to join the private beta. GitHub was probably the first Git-related tool I encountered which actually looked nice. Hard to believe that so much time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(No, I don&amp;rsquo;t find Git hard to use. And I have basically stopped losing work since I started using Git, something which has happened too often before.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static Site generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around with several static site generators to replace my blogging software. I checked out several generators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting because it uses Python and Jinja2 which should make it easier to reuse the Django templates (or so I thought)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; seems to be very widely used and looks like a good idea to bet on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site runs on Django and I&amp;rsquo;m using a markdown editor based on &lt;a href="https://codemirror.net/"&gt;CodeMirror&lt;/a&gt; in the admin. I do like CodeMirror a lot but I would like it even more if I could use neovim in the console. I know that vim bindings for CodeMirror exist, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good experience with the vim bindings for VisualStudio Code so I&amp;rsquo;m wary (and too lazy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with all those generators are that they have different ideas for how to structure the URLs and RSS/Atom feeds. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514113830/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id"&gt;I have since learned the reason why Pelican doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the permalink of posts as their Atom ID&lt;/a&gt; (from the &lt;code&gt;feedgenerator&lt;/code&gt; module) but I&amp;rsquo;m just not convinced that flooding aggregators with old posts is a net benefit to everyone. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s only once but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;m now thinking about writing my own static site generator, for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks, Tim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been coworking with &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@CodenameTim@fosstodon.org/109807763335807167"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; to write more. Tim and I have been maintaining the &lt;a href="https://jazzband.co/projects/django-debug-toolbar"&gt;django-debug-toolbar&lt;/a&gt; together in the last few years and have been pairing up every one or two weeks to write together (mostly) in silence as described by &lt;a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/mar/9/coworking-to-write-more/"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss in his blog entry&lt;/a&gt; a few times. Today I really needed the additional motivation brought by committing to work together. If not for this arrangement I would probably have skipped it and who knows if I had managed to restart the weeknotes streak next week on my own&amp;hellip;!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 8 and 9)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-8-and-9/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-8-and-9/</id><published>2023-03-03T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-03-03T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 8 and 9)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was a short work week. We spent a few nights in the mountains. Not much snow though. Enough for some skiing and sledging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work week was &amp;hellip; not normal. Many meetings, not enough time to work on projects. That shortens these week notes a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Django Software Foundation membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out through Tim that I have been &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/2023/jan/12/dsf-board-monthly-meeting/"&gt;approved as an individual member of the Django Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m honored and hope that this will be another way where I can give something back. It also feels good to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/minutes/"&gt;meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt; were public. I still use RSS and can wholeheartedly recommend &lt;a href="https://theoldreader.com/"&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt; (no affiliation) and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try adding a RSS feed of meeting minutes to the website. &lt;a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/pull/1316"&gt;The pull request is still being reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-forms documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-forms"&gt;feincms3-forms&lt;/a&gt; README a bit. The README hopefully clarifies the purpose and the components of the app a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely flexible forms builder for the Django admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Migrating from Bitbucket to GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a long time Bitbucket user since GitHub used a pricing where many private repositories were very expensive and Bitbucket only charged a fee per user. This has changed long ago though. I wanted to consolidate the tools used at $work and have therefore taken the time to move all private repositores to GitHub. Determining the list of repositories in a Bitbucket Workspace was surprisingly annoying but I got there in the end with an app-specific password and curl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I converted the JSON into a list of Git/SSH cloning URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import json, sys

d = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
print(
    "\n".join(
        next(link["href"] for link in rec["links"]["clone"] if link["name"] == "ssh")
        for rec in d["values"]
    )
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it as (I had to repeat the first command for every 100 repos):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 filter.py &amp;lt; repos.json &amp;gt;&amp;gt; clone.txt
for url in $(cat clone.txt); do (cd mirror; git clone --mirror $url) ; done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I wrote another Python script to create the repositores and upload them all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import sys
from subprocess import run

for repo in sys.argv[1:]:
    run(f"gh repo create --private feinheit-archive/{repo[:-4]}", shell=True, check=True)
    run(f"cd {repo} &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push git@github.com:feinheit-archive/{repo[:-4]}.git --all", shell=True, check=True)
    run(f"rm -rf {repo}", shell=True, check=True)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ran ist as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd mirror
python3 ../upload.py *
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough I learned that GitHub ratelimits repository creation. So I had to wait an hour after several dozen repos and start the command again afterwards. Of course the code wasn&amp;rsquo;t written defensively at first and deleted repos which weren&amp;rsquo;t uploaded yet so I had to work out the set of repos I have to re-download from Bitbucket&amp;hellip; I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit surprising that &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t raise an exception by default when a command fails. &lt;code&gt;check=True&lt;/code&gt; should definitely be the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not posting the code because I&amp;rsquo;m proud but because I&amp;rsquo;m not. Throwing such stuff together with Python feels great, and using &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run(..., shell=True)&lt;/code&gt; is more fun than writing bash scripts with &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Frontend frameworks to kickstart your site and to drag you down later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer blog post is in the making as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to formulate my thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend frameworks are a great help in getting a product out of the door quickly. But tools and needs evolve. Backwards incompatible versions&lt;sup id="fnref:semver"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:semver"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of those Frameworks are published. And then it happens: Too many things break at once and you have to pick up the pieces. What has been an advantage in the beginning drags you down, because now you have to maintain not just your own code but also everything you used from $framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had been (even 😂) more cautious when selecting tools for potentially long running projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:semver"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stuff breaks even when updating patch versions.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:semver" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;iOS and Kiosk mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research on easy ways to put an iPad into Kiosk mode because I want to build a surveying app for an exposition. The web platform is perfect for this especially given the budget constraints&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;a href="https://www.hexnode.com/blogs/what-is-ios-kiosk-mode/"&gt;What is iOS kiosk mode and how do I enable it?&lt;/a&gt; was a great overview over the available options for using iPads in Kiosk mode. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to build an app myself even though this would be relatively straightforward e.g. with React Native&lt;sup id="fnref:rn"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rn"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen"&gt;MDN Foxes example&lt;/a&gt; worked nicely apart from the fact that the bar containing the clock and indicators is still shown. This is probably an acceptable trade off, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitbucket to GitHub migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally managed to bump against the GitHub API&amp;rsquo;s rate limit. I have transferred more than 300 private Git repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub. Most repositories aren&amp;rsquo;t used actively anymore, so it&amp;rsquo;s not really about GitHub vs. Bitbucket. The goal was simply to have one less tool to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading the list of all repositores in a workspace was surprisingly annoying and I spent too much time bumping my head against the API authentication. In the end all I had to do was to generate an app specific password and authenticate with that and with my own username. It&amp;rsquo;s funny to me how simple things like that are still hard after working more than 15 years in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off by ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still progressing with learning &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; puzzles. Last night I was really close to a working solution but then I spent a lot of time chasing down off by one errors. I was totally aware that I should pay attention when writing the loop (respectively the range) and I still failed. Oh well, in the end it worked and I still had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do stolen bikes go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has probably seen that one already but I thought it was a really interesting study:
&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/where-do-stolen-bikes-go-0215"&gt;Where do stolen bikes go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also charted the movement of the bikes. Out of the 70 stolen bikes, 68 remained in the local Amsterdam area. Between three and six of those spent enough time in the vicinity of second-hand bike stores that the researchers concluded they were probably sold there. Another 12 bikes were taken to locations identified as places where bicycles are known to be sold informally, on the bicycle black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-data/"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt;: I wrote about circular references last week; this week I got confirmation that the code works and so I released it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-admin-sso/"&gt;django-admin-sso&lt;/a&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a project I&amp;rsquo;m not really using anymore, but I&amp;rsquo;m still maintaining it when it&amp;rsquo;s not much work. Switch to &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s admin SSO support if you can since django-admin-sso still uses the deprecated oauth2client library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rn"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some experience with React Native. It&amp;rsquo;s great to get started and works surprisingly well for a long time. The problems arrive one you want to optimize the behavior on all platforms and screen sizes but that&amp;rsquo;s a hard problem, so maybe problems shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise anyone.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rn" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some progress learning Rust. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look up each character and function and am slowly getting a feel for the language, unwrapping and the borrow checker, so that&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a use for it for now, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-data and data cycles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added support for loading data with cyclic dependencies to &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data"&gt;feincms3-data&lt;/a&gt;. This is useful e.g. when having Django models where you have a &lt;code&gt;ForeignKey("self")&lt;/code&gt; and you want to use feincms3-data to insert a new copy of some object and its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editing trees in the Django administration interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back to one of my favorite (not) activities which is making tree-shaped data editable in the Django administration panel. &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/feincms"&gt;FeinCMS&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/"&gt;django-mptt&lt;/a&gt; augments the changelist with some drag drop behavior. There&amp;rsquo;s no undo functionality though so making errors is potentially really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt; uses a separate page for moving nodes around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m working on a &lt;a href="https://preactjs.com/"&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt;-based project which also doesn&amp;rsquo;t use drag drop but which also allows inserting nodes, not just moving nodes around. I doubt I can make it reusable enough to make it useful for feincms3 but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 5)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-5/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-5/</id><published>2023-02-04T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-02-04T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 5)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time has passed since I tried writing week notes. Oh well, here we go again. No committment here, just hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really got into listening to podcasts in the last few weeks. That&amp;rsquo;s new for me, I never enjoyed listening to people talk when I could also listen to music. So, that&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts I like a lot: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast"&gt;The Ezra Klein Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://djangochat.com/"&gt;Django Chat&lt;/a&gt; and some others where I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet listened enough to list them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that Advent of Code existed quite long already but I never dug into it. I participated in the 2022 Advent of Code and enjoyed it a lot. I have long been unsecure regarding my programming skills since I do not have a formal CS background so it felt really good to be able to solve many problems with only a little help. Definitely not all of them though. It definitely was fun and I&amp;rsquo;m still working through other years a bit. Python is the most fun, JavaScript is sometimes nice. Rust gives me a hard time (or I&amp;rsquo;m giving myself a hard time) but the upside is that solving even easy puzzles feels very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I released new versions of &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tree-queries/"&gt;django-tree-queries&lt;/a&gt;, only patch releases. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that much open source work in the last weeks or months; it really depends a lot on the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing during the day at &lt;a href="https://feinheit.ch/"&gt;Feinheit&lt;/a&gt;. The activity in the open source project space is mostly always higher when I&amp;rsquo;m starting many small new projects and not so much when working on big old projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django 4.2a1 has been released, and the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch of Django will be the upcoming 5.0 release which will break backwards compatibility again. The minimum Python requirement has been bumped to Python 3.10, which caused and still causes some work in updating the CI job lists. Good to see that the world is moving forward here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I always try deploying the last and best version of Django in my current projects, but since one of our servers is still using Ubuntu 18.04 with an old PostgreSQL version I cannot even use Django 4.1 with many projects. That makes me sad but maybe the sadness will bring with it the energy to finally move to containers or something which makes it easier to jump to new versions. We&amp;rsquo;ll see. It&amp;rsquo;s not really an issue most of the time so maybe it still isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it even though I feel like our hosting strategy is stuck in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some playing around with Dall-E and ChatGPT (as everyone seems to do). I had a few interesting discussions with people re. if predicting the next word will lead to Artificial General Intelligence (I don&amp;rsquo;t think so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was fun about it was that I got to throw a hack together with &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"&gt;asyncio&lt;/a&gt; respectively &lt;a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/"&gt;uvicorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.starlette.io/"&gt;Starlette&lt;/a&gt;. The Starlette source code is a breath of fresh air. It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful to read and I just love how much it does with a minimal amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2021 week 13 and 14)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2021-week-13-and-14/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2021-week-13-and-14/</id><published>2021-04-11T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2021-04-11T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2021 week 13 and 14)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sorting django-admin-ordering instances in Python code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/"&gt;django-admin-ordering&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &lt;code&gt;OrderableModel&lt;/code&gt; gained a &lt;code&gt;__lt__&lt;/code&gt; function (and &lt;code&gt;functools.total_ordering&lt;/code&gt;) in 0.14 which allows sorting model instances in Python code. This is useful for my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some user agents do not like single quotes in OpenGraph tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django autoescapes content inserted into HTML (an excellent default). It also converts some special characters into entities (resp., &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;html.escape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does this). It seems that some user agents do not like entities in OpenGraph tags and show &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x27;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;. Oh well. &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-meta/commit/c2524581f29ff0cbf2d1e7af419f6f943685a296"&gt;I added a workaround for this problem to feincms3-meta.&lt;/a&gt; It checks whether the value is safe&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and basically skips escaping in this case &amp;ndash; at least I hope it is safe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-forms – A new forms builder for the Django admin interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a current project &lt;a href="https://feinheit.ch/"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; needed a forms builder with the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple fields (text, email, checkboxes, dropdowns etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom validation and processing logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be possible to add other content, e.g. headings and explanations between form fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms/form_designer"&gt;form_designer&lt;/a&gt; fulfilled a few of these requirements but not all. It still works well but I wanted a forms builder based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-content-editor"&gt;django-content-editor&lt;/a&gt; for a long time already. Also, I really like the feincms3 pattern where the third party app only provides abstract models. Yeah, it is much more work to start with but the flexibility and configurability is worth it – especially since it&amp;rsquo;s possible to write straightforward code to handle special cases&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; instead of configuring even more settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humble beginnings are here in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-forms/"&gt;feincms3-forms&lt;/a&gt; repository. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-forms/tree/main/tests/testapp"&gt;test suite already shows how things work together&lt;/a&gt; but as of now no documentation exists and no release has been made yet. I hope it will be ready for a first beta release in the next few weeks 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much open source work this week. The final thesis and presentation for the CAS in Interaction Design was due.

&lt;h2&gt;FeinCMS 1.20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some FeinCMS 1.x ItemEditor element attributes clashed with new IDs introduced in Django 3.1. The new version of FeinCMS fixes this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;django-simple-redirects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.redirects&lt;/code&gt; app has a hard dependency on &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.sites&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of NOT hardcoding the current site into the database or into settings except where absolutely necessary. Because of this I extracted the parts I liked into a standalone package with a &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-sane-redirects/"&gt;questionable and needlessly derogatory name&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. The old package is still around (no need to break setups) but the package has been renamed to &lt;strong&gt;django-simple-redirects&lt;/strong&gt;, cleaned up for current versions of Python and Django and also been uploaded to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-simple-redirects/"&gt;django-simple-redirects on PyPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;feincms3: Page types and moving torwards a 1.0 release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst"&gt;current beta release of feincms3 (0.90b*)&lt;/a&gt; introduces support for &lt;strong&gt;page types&lt;/strong&gt;. This new concept unifies templates and apps. Since feincms3 apps can basically do what they want it didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense to force managers to choose a template when they already selected an app. Sometimes, we offered managers a &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; template and a &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; app and they had to select both. This duplication was hard to explain and justify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the only backwards-incompatible change in 0.90b*. The default image plugins now always have a caption and an alternative text field; the versatileimagefield-based plugin is gone as are the shims in &lt;code&gt;feincms3.apps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to release a 1.0 of feincms3 soon-ish. It&amp;rsquo;s time to do this. feincms3 is in its fifth year of existence, several sites built with it have already been archived already, so it&amp;rsquo;s definitely past due. (django-content-editor (resp. FeinCMS 1.x) more than 12 years old now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-mptt is not maintained anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the maintainers of django-mptt &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/pull/776"&gt;have marked django-mptt as unmaintained&lt;/a&gt;. I have released the current development version as 0.12.0 before proposing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s ltree extension vs. django-tree-queries&amp;rsquo; recursive CTEs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the (excellent) question why I wrote that PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s ltree extension didn&amp;rsquo;t seem a good solution &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/django-tree-queries/"&gt;in my post about django-tree-queries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/406-comments/issues/2#issuecomment-797981910"&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my current thinking on this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going all-in on CSS Grid and PostCSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer"&gt;autoprefixer&lt;/a&gt; for years already. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the best-known &lt;a href="https://postcss.org/"&gt;PostCSS&lt;/a&gt; plugin. It automatically adds vendor-specific prefixes to your CSS code (e.g. &lt;code&gt;-moz-*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-webkit-*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-ms-*&lt;/code&gt; etc.) depending on a list of browsers you want to support and the &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/"&gt;Can I use&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to bring bundling times down and searched for alternatives to Webpack. Webpack isn&amp;rsquo;t the hot new thing anymore but it works really well and performs good enough as long as you do not have extreme amounts of code and plugins. I started with a new, minimal Webpack configuration and was pleasantly surprised that compilation times are more than acceptable when only using babel-loader to transpile JavaScript and some PostCSS. (I may write about the setup at a later time, for now &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/our-approach-to-configuring-django-webpack-and-manifeststaticfilesstorage/"&gt;this approach&lt;/a&gt; still serves &lt;a href="https://feinheit.ch/"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt; well and we have even packaged it up as &lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/fh-webpack-config/"&gt;fh-webpack-config&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing the main branch to main&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/dotfiles/commit/3a2e3ff58de38aa8e03ca1d684504ebea02cdd6c"&gt;following alias to my &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fix the problem where the &lt;code&gt;refs/remotes/origin/HEAD&lt;/code&gt; of local repositories would point to &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; after renaming the branch on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config --global alias.mainfix "symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git mainfix&lt;/code&gt; is easier to type than &lt;code&gt;vim .git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD&lt;/code&gt; and replacing whatever the previous main branch was called with &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;neovim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have switched from vim to neovim. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember why but the transition has been seamless. I&amp;rsquo;m still happy with tmux and vim.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
