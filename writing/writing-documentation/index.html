Similar to writing tests or commit messages, writing docs is a way of thinking about the same issues from a different viewpoint, with a different part of the brain so to speak.<p>Sometimes code feels bad, but it’s hard to tell why. Surprisingly often the badness really shows itself as soon as I start writing docs. The <a href=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>Zen of Python</a> says it much better than I could:<blockquote><p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.<p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</blockquote><h2>When do I write documentation?</h2><p>I mostly start writing documentation when the first or second iteration of a project basically works and when it is time to move towards the beta quality stage. Documenting alpha quality software is mostly not worth the effort; it only adds documentation churn to code churn.<p>Documenting a 1.0 release is too late except for trivial software, since documenting often surfaces simpler ways to achieve the same results.<h2>Docs I spent a lot of time on</h2><p>I’m quite proud of the following projects’ documentation:<h3><a href=https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/>feincms3</a></h3><p>The first versions were only documented using docstrings and autodoc, the current version is split into different sections: First steps, guides and reference. Readers should be able to understand and use the information in guides independently, without having to read everything.<h3><a href=https://github.com/matthiask/django-translated-fields>django-translated-fields</a></h3><p>A simple project with little functionality; the README is the only documentation this project has. Still, the README is almost three times longer than the packages’ Python code combined.<h3><a href=https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer>html-sanitizer</a></h3><p>I wish all my projects’ documentations had a short paragraph at the top explaining what the project is about, how it compares to other solutions attacking the same problem space and provide a list of goals the project is supposed to achieve.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Writing documentation">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2018-09-22 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
