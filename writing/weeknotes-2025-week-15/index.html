I had a great time as a navigator and am looking forward to participate more, but for now I’m also glad that I do not have the additional responsibility at least for the close future.<p>We have done great work on the <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/>django-debug-toolbar</a> in our group, more is to come.<h2 id=progress-on-the-prose-editor><a class=toclink href=#progress-on-the-prose-editor>Progress on the prose editor</a></h2><p>I have done much work on <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-prose-editor/>django-prose-editor</a> in the last few weeks and after a large list of alphas and betas I’m nearing a state which I want to release into the wild.<p>The integration has been completely rethought (again) and now uses JavaScript modules and importmaps. The ground work to support all of that in Django has been laid in <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/>django-js-asset</a>.<p>The nice thing about using JavaScript modules and importmaps is that we now have an easy way to combine the power of modern JavaScript customization with easy cache busting using Django’s <code>ManifestStaticFilesStorage</code>. A longer post on this is brewing and I hope to have it ready soon-ish.<p>As a sneak peek, here’s the way it works:<div class=chl><pre><span></span><code><span class=kn>from</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nn>django_prose_editor.fields</span><span class=w> </span><span class=kn>import</span> <span class=n>ProseEditorField</span>

    <span class=p>},</span>

<span class=p>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The nice thing about it is that the sanitization allowlist for <a href=https://github.com/messense/nh3>nh3</a> only includes tags and attributes which are enabled via the <code>extensions</code> dict. So, you don’t have to do anything else to be safe from XSS etc.<p>Check out the pre-releases on <a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-prose-editor/#history>PyPI</a> or have a look at the <a href=https://django-prose-editor.readthedocs.io/>documentation</a> to learn more about this project!<h2 id=using-claude-code><a class=toclink href=#using-claude-code>Using Claude Code</a></h2><p>I have been using Claude Code (without editor integrations, thank you very much) more and more. It’s a good coding companion when it comes to throwing around ideas, drafting docs and writing unit tests including integration tests.<p>Sometimes I’m really surprised at how good it is. Other times… less so. The tool often finds a way to get tests passing, but when the editor integration tests directly manipulate <code>innerHTML</code> and then Claude proclaims that interacting with the editor is now shown to work I have to chuckle a bit. And when I insist on doing what I mean and not just finding broken workarounds it doesn’t really change anything. After spinning more we’re always back where we started.<p>I am somewhat glad that this is where we’re at now. I’m not 100% sure if it’s progress. At least it’s surprisingly funny at times.<h2 id=releases><a class=toclink href=#releases>Releases</a></h2><p>I haven’t written a regular weeknotes entry since the end of January, so naturally the list here is longer than usual.<ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-forms/>feincms3-forms 0.5.1</a>: I inadvertently bumped the Django dependency without actually wanting that; this patch release reverts that (while adding official support for new Django and Python versions).<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-mptt/>django-mptt 0.17</a>: Mariusz has done all the hard work for supporting newer versions of Django. I just had to press the release button. That being said, four years after marking the package as unmaintained I’m still maintaining it. At least I don’t get complaints anymore…<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-json-schema-editor/>django-json-schema-editor 0.4</a>: Added a dependency on the pre-release of django-prose-editor and added a test suite including integration tests so that we actually now when stuff breaks the next time!<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/>django-debug-toolbar 5.1</a>: See above.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-data/>feincms3-data</a>: Added fixes to dump distinct objects. Spent more time than useful on the Django change which added a final newline to JSON-serialized data.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/>django-js-asset 3.1.2</a>: Importmaps support, added a <code>static_lazy</code> helper which is useful to define module-scoped static URLs. The later wouldn’t work with the <code>ManifestStaticFilesStorage</code> because the manifest doesn’t yet exist when <code>collectstatic</code> runs, so the actual evaluation of static URLs has to be postponed. The lazy version solves this nicely.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/>feincms3-sites 0.21.1</a> and <a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/>feincms3-language-sites 0.4.1</a>: See the relevant <a href=https://406.ch/writing/til-tools-exist-which-do-not-lowercase-domain-names-when-requesting-websites-over-http-s/>TIL</a> blogpost.</ul></div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/customizing-django-admin-fieldsets-without-fearing-forgotten-fields/>Newer post</a><a href=/writing/ungoogling-my-life/>Older post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2025 week 15)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2025-04-09 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
