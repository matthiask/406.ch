I don’t have to look up each character and function and am slowly getting a feel for the language, unwrapping and the borrow checker, so that’s nice.<p>I don’t have a use for it for now, but we’ll see.<h2>feincms3-data and data cycles</h2><p>I added support for loading data with cyclic dependencies to <a href=https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data>feincms3-data</a>. This is useful e.g. when having Django models where you have a <code>ForeignKey("self")</code> and you want to use feincms3-data to insert a new copy of some object and its dependencies.<h2>Editing trees in the Django administration interface</h2><p>I’m back to one of my favorite (not) activities which is making tree-shaped data editable in the Django administration panel. <a href=https://github.com/feincms/feincms>FeinCMS</a> and later <a href=https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/>django-mptt</a> augments the changelist with some drag drop behavior. There’s no undo functionality though so making errors is potentially really bad.<p><a href=https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/>feincms3</a> uses a separate page for moving nodes around.<p>Now I’m working on a <a href=https://preactjs.com/>Preact</a>-based project which also doesn’t use drag drop but which also allows inserting nodes, not just moving nodes around. I doubt I can make it reusable enough to make it useful for feincms3 but we’ll see.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 6)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-02-10 in <a href=/writing/category-django//>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming//>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes//>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
