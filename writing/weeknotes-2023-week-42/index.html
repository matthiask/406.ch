The voyage by train was very comfortable and we had a great time there. I have lived close to lakes all my life but the sea is always something else. Now I enjoy the cold temperatures of fall.<h2 id=going-back-forward-to-gitjournal><a class=toclink href=#going-back-forward-to-gitjournal>Going back (forward) to GitJournal</a></h2><p>I have tried several note taking apps but I’m now back using <a href=https://gitjournal.io/>GitJournal</a> with a Git repository filled with Markdown notes. It works well enough. I just wish that there was a way to make notes more distinguishable and I wish that the editor was more forgiving when encountering badly formatted checklists.<h2 id=analog-blogging><a class=toclink href=#analog-blogging>Analog blogging</a></h2><p>I have long wanted to write about <a href=https://406.ch/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/>our switch from Slack to Discord</a>. I have started to write this post with pen and paper. I find that I think better when using pen and paper than when using the computer keyboard. One factor is certainly that the computer offers more distractions, but I suspect that another, more important factor is that as a fast typist the fingers and the thinking are always getting out of step, and this happens less when using a slower method of writing. This actually isn’t an idea I had myself, but I don’t remember where I got it from.<h2 id=zero-based-versioning-good-or-bad><a class=toclink href=#zero-based-versioning-good-or-bad>Zero-based versioning: Good or bad?</a></h2><p>I discovered <a href=https://0ver.org/>ZeroVer</a> sometime in the last few days. I have many many Django packages with zero-based versions. Some of them have been used in production for years now. I sometimes wonder if staying with <code>0.</code> is unprofessional and I should just release 1.0 and be done with it or if it doesn’t really matter at all.<p>If I evaluate software packages more often than not I don’t look at the version number or the version numbering scheme (except when a package is still using <code>0.0.</code>) when deciding whether to rely on it or not. The documentation and the code itself are much more important to me.<h2 id=releases><a class=toclink href=#releases>Releases</a></h2><p>I haven’t uploaded any releases in the last 14 days. That’s good: I’m one of those people who have made their passion their job (which is great) but that sometimes makes it hard to not work at all since I can always tell myself that I’m not working, that it’s just a hobby.</div><div class="text prevnext"><a href=/writing/customize-the-django-admin-to-differentiate-environments/>Previous post</a><a href=/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/>Next post</a></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2023 week 42)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2023-10-18 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a>, <a href=/writing/category-feincms/>feincms</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-dark></script></div></footer>
