I previously wrote about my <a href=https://406.ch/writing/my-rules-for-releasing-open-source-software/>rules for releasing open source software</a> but skipped everything related to versioning.<p>I use something close to the ideas of <a href=https://semver.org/>semantic versioning</a> but it’s not quite that. Note that the versioning scheme has nothing to do with production readiness, it’s more about communicating the state of the project.<h2 id=00x-everything-breaks><a class=toclink href=#00x-everything-breaks>0.0.x – Everything breaks</a></h2><p>I don’t trust my choices a lot. Everything may radically change, and I may also abandon the project with no hard feelings.<h2 id=010-changelogging><a class=toclink href=#010-changelogging>0.1.0 – Changelogging</a></h2><p>I generally start writing release notes or rather a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog>Changelog</a>, since writing full release notes is much more work. You absolutely have to test the software and I do not guarantee anything related to backwards compatibility – just that you’ll know about breaking changes when you read the CHANGELOG.<h2 id=x-bugfixes-and-pure-additions><a class=toclink href=#x-bugfixes-and-pure-additions>?.?.x – Bugfixes and pure additions</a></h2><p>Strictly speaking, patch version increments are only for bugfixes. However, when I add new features which are purely additional to the package or if there’s no way (famous last words) that anything will break, I’ll upload a patch release.<p>Sometimes it might be better to increment the minor version, yes. But, being very lazy, I sometimes only want to add a line to the CHANGELOG instead of adding a new heading for the new release. Also, if I don’t quickly release new additions there’s a real danger that I’ll only come back to the project weeks or months later, and I don’t want anyone (myself included) waiting on these updates. Also, if I inadvertently introduced new bugs it’s better to fix them quickly instead of forgetting about it first and having to rediscover the buggy code later.<h2 id=100-im-happy><a class=toclink href=#100-im-happy>1.0.0 – I’m happy</a></h2><p>I’m happy with the package and I commit to start using semver more properly. If I have to (or want to) break backwards compatibility you get a migration path, especially if I need it myself. Which is often the case since I’m maintaining dozens of Django-based websites and webapps, and I’m always <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food>dogfooding</a> my stuff.<p>The pure additions case from the last section still applies, since slapping a 1.0 version on something doesn’t suddenly make me less lazy.<h2 id=outliers><a class=toclink href=#outliers>Outliers</a></h2><p><a href=https://github.com/feincms/feincms>FeinCMS</a> uses a variant of <a href=https://calver.org/>calendar versioning</a>; the version at the time of writing is 24.8.2 which means the second release in August 2024.<p>There are probably other outliers I forgot about.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=How I handle versioning">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-08-20 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
