&lt;p&gt;We have spent a wonderful family week in Italy. The voyage by train was very
comfortable and we had a great time there. I have lived close to lakes all my
life but the sea is always something else. Now I enjoy the cold temperatures of
fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going back (forward) to GitJournal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried several note taking apps but I&amp;rsquo;m now back using
&lt;a href="https://gitjournal.io/"&gt;GitJournal&lt;/a&gt; with a Git repository filled with Markdown
notes. It works well enough. I just wish that there was a way to make notes
more distinguishable and I wish that the editor was more forgiving when
encountering badly formatted checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analog blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long wanted to write about &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/"&gt;our switch from Slack to
Discord&lt;/a&gt;.
I have started to write this post with pen and paper. I find that I think
better when using pen and paper than when using the computer keyboard. One
factor is certainly that the computer offers more distractions, but I suspect
that another, more important factor is that as a fast typist the fingers and
the thinking are always getting out of step, and this happens less when using a
slower method of writing. This actually isn&amp;rsquo;t an idea I had myself, but I don&amp;rsquo;t
remember where I got it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero-based versioning: Good or bad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href="https://0ver.org/"&gt;ZeroVer&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the last few days. I have
many many Django packages with zero-based versions. Some of them have been used
in production for years now. I sometimes wonder if staying with &lt;code&gt;0.&lt;/code&gt; is
unprofessional and I should just release 1.0 and be done with it or if it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I evaluate software packages more often than not I don&amp;rsquo;t look at the version
number or the version numbering scheme (except when a package is still using
&lt;code&gt;0.0.&lt;/code&gt;) when deciding whether to rely on it or not. The documentation and the
code itself are much more important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t uploaded any releases in the last 14 days. That&amp;rsquo;s good: I&amp;rsquo;m one of
those people who have made their passion their job (which is great) but that
sometimes makes it hard to not work at all since I can always tell myself that
I&amp;rsquo;m not working, that it&amp;rsquo;s just a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Why we switched from Slack to Discord at Work</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-discord-at-work/</id><published>2023-10-15T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-10-15T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why we switched from Slack to Discord at Work&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have switched from Slack to Discord at &lt;a href="https://feinheit.ch"&gt;Feinheit&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. This post explores the history, the reasons for the switch and what we learned in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The early days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days we used Skype group chats. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we stopped.
We probably became too numerous for a single chat. After we stopped we
certainly missed the easy way to share things with everyone. An alternative had
to be found. Company based social networks were the hype for a short amount of
time. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember the name of the product we used, that probably says
enough about that. Suffice to say that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a happy time tool-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Slack. Finally we had something easy to use, again. Need a new space to
discuss something? Just open a new channel, everybody can do it! Need to ask a
specific person something? Direct messages are right there, and (arguably) much
better than always interrupting people by walking to their desk for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my personal lived experience rapidly deteriorated. I wanted to be
accessible for urgent inquiries to unblock colleagues when they needed
something. But this also fostered an ASAP culture. Project managers knew I was
almost always available. It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that some were terribly unorganized at
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since asking was easier that searching the documentation or the handbook people
didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to document things anymore. The information was shared in Slack
but since nobody found the relevant messages after time had passed the same
questions were asked (and answered) over and over. Slack became the place where
knowledge goes to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a time Slack became my primary source of stress. I tried several times to
stop using it. I suffered an unreasonable amount of FOMO&lt;sup id="fnref:fomo"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fomo"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; during that
time but it was also true that I did not know stuff which was only shared on
Slack by others. I asked myself many times what my problem was and why I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;simply&amp;rdquo; shut it off and ignore the downsides. And a minor but still
important point, ignore the unread messages indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I learned of others who felt the same way, mostly outside the company
but some of them at Feinheit. Slack had to go. The question was: Which tool
could be a suitable replacement? Given the title of this post it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come
as a surprise that the answer was Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digression: Project management software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably important to know that we have been using a project management
tool and also issue trackers all this time. So, Slack really wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a
possibly improved&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; replacement for mail-based project management. Slack
mainly crept into the project management tooling because some people perceived
it to be more modern: A simpler way for those asking others for their time or
knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discord as an addition, not a replacement for project management software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started using Discord in the summer of 2021 with a clear set of rules
and a small number of channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important rules are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord is the place for casual and informal exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody is expected to read anything on Discord. If it is expected that people
  actually receive a message it must not be shared on Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No discussing project work, not in channels nor in direct messages. The
  former is enforced by a short list of moderators, the latter is formulated as
  an expectation (since it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to enforce).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules message also contains a direct message to a shared to do list, where
everyone can easily assign to do items to others without having to find the
project&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker. This is especially important because we have many
small projects and no one works on all of them. If assigning to dos wasn&amp;rsquo;t
relatively straightforward people would understandably fall back to direct
messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Server configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are able to uphold these rules because of Discord&amp;rsquo;s strong moderation
features (compared to Slack). Discord is much more configurable. Our server is
configured in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Channel creation is disallowed. Only moderators can create new channels; if
  someone asks for a new channel, the request is denied if it is probable that
  the rules above would be broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one is expected to accept DMs from other members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threads are disabled. The structure they provide makes it acceptable to loop
  people into a &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; conversation which 99% of the time belongs somewhere
  more permanent, for example the project management software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just the most important points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Channels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing those are our text channels (The names are translated to their equivalents):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#reception&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this is the only channel people see when they haven&amp;rsquo;t been
  given the appropriate role. This is necessary because everybody can join a
  server if they have an invite code and we don&amp;rsquo;t want random people to read
  everything we post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#staircase&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the place to say hello, bye, and a few things in-between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#random&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; all servers need this :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#politics&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; a separate space for politics. Everything&amp;rsquo;s political, and we are too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#inspiration&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; I myself thought that &lt;code&gt;#staircase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#random&lt;/code&gt; would be
  sufficient but people wanted this and the moderators didn&amp;rsquo;t think that this
  additional channel would lead to a violation of the rules above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have two voice channels, &lt;code&gt;cow-orking&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sofa&lt;/code&gt;. The former
was used more ofting when more people were working from home to have a place to
hear from others, the latter is more an invitation to talk. More talk happens
in-person in the office these days, but when working remotely it&amp;rsquo;s still nice
to know that those channels are just a click away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself have joined the work discord using my private account and I feel good
about that. I&amp;rsquo;m not friends with everyone at work but I certainly have good
relationships with basically everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did not live-stream my activities to Discord before creating the work
server anyway so there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a change there at all. And people mostly
know that Discord is about the slowest place to get something from me (and I
make a point of it!) so even if people do not heed the &amp;ldquo;No DMs&amp;rdquo; rule above this
behavior isn&amp;rsquo;t really reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually really happy with the way we&amp;rsquo;re using these tools these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned feincms3-sites last week in my last weeknotes entry; I have
again given this package a lot of attention in the last days, so another update
is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to override the list of languages available on each site.
That&amp;rsquo;s especially useful for an upcoming campaign site where the umbrella
group&amp;rsquo;s site is available in three languages, but (most?) individual group
sites (hosted on subdomains) will only have a subset of languages. Since I live
in a country with four national languages (english isn&amp;rsquo;t one of them, but is
spoken by many!) supporting more than one language, or even many languages is
totally commonplace. It&amp;rsquo;s great that Django has good support for
internationalization. For the sake of an example, I have the following sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;: The default. The host has to match exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;subdomain.example.com&lt;/code&gt;: One individual group&amp;rsquo;s site. The host has to match the regex &lt;code&gt;^subdomain\.&lt;/code&gt; (sorry, I actually do like regexes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overriding configured hosts for local development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which always annoyed me when using &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.sites&lt;/code&gt; was that
&amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; pulling the database from production to the local development
environment always produced links pointing back to the remote host instead of
working locally (when producing absolute URLs). This problem was shared by
feincms3-sites as well. I have now found a very ugly but perfectly workable
solution: Overwrite &lt;code&gt;Site.get_host()&lt;/code&gt; locally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;example.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Or whatever&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8000&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;FEINCMS3_SITES_SITE_GET_HOST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works especially well when using &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; and maybe subdomains of
&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;: All absolute links will point to &lt;code&gt;localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;subdomain.localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;*.localhost&lt;/code&gt; always resolves to the local IP
the browser knows where it should connect to, and since
&lt;code&gt;subdomain.localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt; also matches the &lt;code&gt;^subdomain\.&lt;/code&gt; regex mentioned
above, the site selection logic works as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if you have more domains, not just subdomains, you could adapt the
&lt;code&gt;get_host&lt;/code&gt; override and the relevant regexes to those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re at 100% code coverage now when running the test suite. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging into the Django admin using your Google account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This functionality has long been provided by
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-admin-sso&lt;/a&gt;; however, as
mentioned a long time ago this package still uses a deprecated OAuth2 library.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt; supports using a
Google account to authenticate with the Django admin since 2017. I have now
fixed a small problem with it: If you are logged into a single Google account,
and this account&amp;rsquo;s email address doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the configured admin login rule,
you were out of luck: There was no way to add another account at that time
because the library didn&amp;rsquo;t request the account selection. That has changed now,
if the first login attempt doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, it now explicitly tells Google to let
the user select their Google account. A small quality of life improvement for
those using more than one Google account (voluntarily or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.4.3&lt;/a&gt;: Polished the CKEditor integration a little bit. Re-enabled the source button now that we&amp;rsquo;re back to using the classic iframe-based editor again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.19.3&lt;/a&gt;: See above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.16.4&lt;/a&gt;: See above.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moving feincms3 repositories into the feincms organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/feincms"&gt;feincms&lt;/a&gt; GitHub organization has seen more
active days when FeinCMS 1.x was still actively developed. Since my interest
has moved to feincms3 some years ago I haven&amp;rsquo;t kept the organization up to
date. That has changed this week, and I have moved most feincms3-related
repositories into the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much though, but it certainly feels more official now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding scheduled tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started using the cronjob schedule feature of GitHub actions to ensure that tests run at least once a month in a few important projects. I want to get notified of changes in Django@main affecting my packages not only when actively working on them. I try to keep up with Django@main in all packages I maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.18.2&lt;/a&gt;: Many releases in the last weeks. Stopped using permanent redirects in DEBUG mode. Avoid migrations when Django adds more languages. Added utilities which allow restricting model relations to objects in the same site (trickier than it sounds). Added utilities for building full URLs to other sites without taxing the database as much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/"&gt;feincms3-language-sites 0.2.0&lt;/a&gt;: No biggie. No permanent redirects in DEBUG mode anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.4.5&lt;/a&gt;: Reduced the byte size of the CSS and JavaScript some more. Added spanish translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.16.3&lt;/a&gt;: I have published a post last week describing the new &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/"&gt;role-based permissions feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-imagefield/"&gt;django-imagefield 0.17&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;process_imagefields&lt;/code&gt; management command now allows specifying globs. If you wanted to prerender all imagefields in the pages app you can use &lt;code&gt;./manage.py process_imagefields pages.*&lt;/code&gt; now instead of listing all image fields&amp;rsquo; labels explicitly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.4.1&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m enormously unhappy but I had to go back to the classic CKEditor instead of using the inline editor. The latter looked much nicer but overriding the Django admin CSS was very very painful. Also, I can totally understand why CKEditor 5 is completely different and why CKEditor 4 is only maintained in a paid LTS plan. It still is making me look for alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-mptt/"&gt;django-mptt 0.15&lt;/a&gt;: I unfortunately am still using this despite the fact that I have marked it as officially unmaintained since march 2021. I did a mediocre job of making the library run on Django@main again. Parts of the library do not work, but since I&amp;rsquo;m not using them I don&amp;rsquo;t care too much. I&amp;rsquo;m still wondering if someone wants to take over maintenance of the library since it still seems to be actively used in projects of others as well. When I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use django-mptt I&amp;rsquo;m still really happy with &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/django-tree-queries/"&gt;django-tree-queries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/form-designer/"&gt;form-designer 0.22&lt;/a&gt;: This is probably my oldest actively developed project these days. 13 years! (Except for django-content-editor of course.) I have modernized the package, switched to hatchling and put out a new release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Keep content managers' admin access up-to-date with role-based permissions</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/keep-content-managers-admin-access-up-to-date-with-role-based-permissions/</id><published>2023-09-20T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-09-20T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Keep content managers&amp;rsquo; Django admin access up-to-date with role-based permissions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#permissions-and-authorization"&gt;Django&amp;rsquo;s built-in permissions
system&lt;/a&gt;
is great if you want fine-grained control of the permissions content
managers should have. The allowlist-based approach where users have no
permissions by default and must be granted each permission individually makes a
lot of sense to me and is easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we build a CMS at &lt;a href="https://feinheit.ch/"&gt;Feinheit&lt;/a&gt; we often use the Django administration panel as a CMS.
Unfortunately, Django doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a way to specify that content managers
should have all permissions in the &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt; app (just as an
example). Adding all current permissions in a particular app is straightforward when using the
&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal"&gt;&lt;code&gt;filter_horizontal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
interface but keeping the list up-to-date later isn&amp;rsquo;t. When we add an
additional &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/my-reaction-to-the-block-driven-cms-blog-post/"&gt;content block
plugin&lt;/a&gt;
we always have to remember to also update the permissions after deploying the
change &amp;ndash; and often, deployment happens some time after the code has been
written, e.g. because clients want to approve the change first. What happens
all too often is that the manual step of updating permissions gets forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has annoyed me (intermittently) for a long time and my preferred solution
has always been to give superuser permissions to everyone and trust them to
not make changes which they aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to according to the &lt;em&gt;Trusted Users
Editing Structured Content&lt;/em&gt; principle which was mentioned in a Django book I
read early in my Django journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The basic ideas of my role-based permissions implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent project has resurfaced this annoyance and I did finally bite the
bullet and implement a solution for this in the form of a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib&lt;/a&gt; extension. The basic ideas are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All users are assigned a single role&lt;/strong&gt;: Single roles sound inflexible, but is
good enough for my default use case. Examples for roles could be &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; (no
additional permissions granted), &lt;em&gt;content managers&lt;/em&gt; (grant access to the pages
and articles apps) or maybe &lt;em&gt;deny auth&lt;/em&gt; (deny access to users, groups and
permissions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The permission check is implemented using a single callable&lt;/strong&gt;: A custom
backend is provided whose only job is to call the correct callable for the
user&amp;rsquo;s current role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The callable either returns a boolean or raises &lt;code&gt;PermissionDenied&lt;/code&gt; to prevent
other backends from granting access&lt;/strong&gt;: No new ideas here, it&amp;rsquo;s exactly what
&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/customizing/#handling-authorization-in-custom-backends"&gt;Django&amp;rsquo;s authentication backends are supposed to
do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permission checkers for the most common scenarios are bundled&lt;/strong&gt;:
django-authlib only ships one permission checker right now, &lt;code&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/code&gt;,
which allows specifying a list of permission name globs to allow and to deny.
Deny overrides allow as is probably expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using roles in your own project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specify the available roles in your settings and add the authentication backend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;authlib.roles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.utils.translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gettext_lazy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;AUTHLIB_ROLES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;default&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;default&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;staff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;editorial staff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;callback&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pages.*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;articles.*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is the necessary additional backend&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;authlib.backends.PermissionsBackend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Maybe you want to use authlib&amp;#39;s email authentication ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;authlib.backends.EmailBackend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ... or the standard username &amp;amp; password combination:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to extend your user model (you have to use &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-custom-user-model"&gt;a custom user model&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re not using django-authlib&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;little_user.User&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;authlib.roles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RoleField&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RoleField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the globbing is flexible, you could also allow users to view all objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*.view_*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could block users from deleting anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*.delete_*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as mentioned above, you can also combine &lt;code&gt;allow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deny&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;deny&lt;/code&gt; wins
over &lt;code&gt;allow&lt;/code&gt;) or even provide your own callables. If you provide your own
callable it must accept &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;perm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; (which may be &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;) as
keyword arguments. Implementing such a callable is probably less work than
implementing an authentication backend yourself; I had to do more work than
initially expected because only implementing &lt;code&gt;.has_perm&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient if
you want to see any apps and models in the admin index page. The current
&lt;code&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/code&gt; implementation is nice and short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;allow_deny_globs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;perm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fnmatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;perm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PermissionDenied&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fnmatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;perm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>My reaction to the block-driven CMS blog post</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/my-reaction-to-the-block-driven-cms-blog-post/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/my-reaction-to-the-block-driven-cms-blog-post/</id><published>2023-08-23T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-08-23T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;My reaction to the block-driven CMS blog post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I read an interesting post on the Lincoln Loop blog called &lt;a href="https://lincolnloop.com/insights/block-driven-cms-is-critical-build-a-future-proof/"&gt;Building a Future-Proof Platform with Block-Driven CMS&lt;/a&gt;. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise to those (few 😄) who know my work in the area of content management systems that the post resonated with me. I found the description of the advantages of block-based CMS editing very clear and I like the emphasis on structuring data well so that it can be reused for multiple distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href="https://www.django-cms.org/"&gt;django CMS&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way to implement a block-driven CMS using Django. Since its inception &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/the-future-of-feincms/"&gt;FeinCMS&lt;/a&gt; was always the smaller, faster and nimbler counterpart to it, achieving the same &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; goals with a fraction of the code and maintenance headaches. django CMS always seems to trail the official releases of Django. django-content-editor and feincms3 are almost always compatible with the development version of Django by way of running the tests with the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch as well. This allows me to be an early adopter of upcoming Django releases with a software stack that&amp;rsquo;s already well tested, or also to report bugs to the Django project itself. All that probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible if feincms3 and its dependencies supported all the things django CMS does, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/the-other-future-of-feincms-django-content-editor-and-feincms3/"&gt;django-content-editor and feincms3&lt;/a&gt; are the legacy of FeinCMS in an even smaller, even more maintainable and even more composable package and while I&amp;rsquo;m definitely always checking out other Django-based CMS I&amp;rsquo;m persuaded that sticking with feincms3 is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 33)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-33/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-33/</id><published>2023-08-20T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-08-20T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 33)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should call these posts weeknotes when I see the posting schedule, but oh well. Keep expectations up but also practice forgiveness when not meeting them, it&amp;rsquo;s fine really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;py_modules&lt;/code&gt; using hatchling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I converted &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/speckenv/"&gt;speckenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-sitemaps/"&gt;django-sitemaps&lt;/a&gt; after finding the following very helpful post on packaging projects consisting of Python modules without any packages: &lt;a href="https://www.stefaanlippens.net/single-python-module-packaging-hatch.html"&gt;Packaging of single Python module projects with Hatch/Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy in hindsight, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant part is including the files in the build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[tool.hatch.build]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv_django.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;speckenv_django_patch.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar and tracing the cause of DB queries in an async world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also started investigating what would have to be changed in django-debug-toolbar to make it fully support async Django. We currently patch Django&amp;rsquo;s database cursors per thread, which works fine in sync Django land to attribute SQL queries to a particular request/response cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since async Django executes DB queries in a thread pool executor and the rest of the work happens inside awaitables (async land) I don&amp;rsquo;t immediately see a way how we could do the same thing. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible to find out which task spawned another task (without dropping down to C?) but maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m overlooking. I hope that someone smarter than me finds a way :-) or that I find the time and motivation to either find a way using Python or using C/Rust/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites 0.16&lt;/a&gt;: I added basic support for &lt;code&gt;i18n_patterns&lt;/code&gt; when using feincms3-sites with its &lt;code&gt;default_language_middleware&lt;/code&gt; (which allows setting a default language per site in case there is no other mechanism overriding it, such as &lt;code&gt;i18n_patterns&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.4.1&lt;/a&gt;: The privacy policy is now linked inside the banner text instead of adding a link after the text. Looks much nicer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="lhttps://pypi.org/project/speckenv/"&gt;speckenv 5.0&lt;/a&gt;: Finally released changes made a long time ago which make one edge case when parsing settings less surprising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.2&lt;/a&gt;: I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much work here again, mostly code reviews, some changes to the ruff configuration and general polishing. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t do the release itself, that was handled by Tim. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/FeinCMS/"&gt;FeinCMS 23.8&lt;/a&gt;: Fixes for Pillow 10, and some feincms3 / django-content-editor interoperability improvements which make it easier to reuse plugins/content types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.1&lt;/a&gt;: Some basic support for using the apps middleware with async Django. Not documented yet and not deployed anywhere but it basically works. Some documentation edits and changes to the inline CKEditor styling because of the recent changes to Django admin&amp;rsquo;s CSS.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@matthiask/110814846128940975"&gt;A recent conversation with Carlton on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; prompted me to write down some of my thoughts re. function- vs class-based views in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The early days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using Django some time after 0.96 and 1.0 all views were
function based. Except when you added a class with a &lt;code&gt;def __call__()&lt;/code&gt; method
yourself &amp;ndash; that was always possible but not really comparable to today&amp;rsquo;s
class-based views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The introduction of class-based views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class based views (both generic versions and the base &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;) were introduced to Django in 2010. Judging from the &lt;a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6735"&gt;ticket tracker&lt;/a&gt; the main motivation was to avoid adding yet another argument to the generic function-based views (GFBV) which were available in Django back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GFBV&amp;rsquo;s argument count was impressive. Two examples follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;object_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slug&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;extra_context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context_processors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_object_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;object&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;archive_month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;month_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;%b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;extra_context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context_processors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_object_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;object&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GFBVs were immediately deprecated when GCBVs were introduced and later removed in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class-based views have to be adapted by calling the &lt;code&gt;View.as_view()&lt;/code&gt; method; &lt;code&gt;as_view()&lt;/code&gt; returns arguably the thing which is viewed (sorry) as the view by Django, it&amp;rsquo;s the thing which gets called with a request and is expected to return a response. This thing in turn instantiates the view object once per request; this means that &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; can be used to save request-specific data such as &lt;code&gt;self.request&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;self.args&lt;/code&gt; but also custom attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GCBV code is extremely factored and decomposed. The &lt;a href="https://ccbv.co,ul/"&gt;Classy Class-Based Views&lt;/a&gt; site mentions that the &lt;code&gt;UpdateView&lt;/code&gt; has 10 separate ancestors and its code is spread across three files. But, the view code for instantiating a model object and handling a form really isn&amp;rsquo;t that complex. Most of the complexity is handled by Django itself, in the request handler and in the &lt;code&gt;django.forms&lt;/code&gt; package. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the reason for all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generic views could be simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that the existing generic views had better building blocks instead of a big hierarchy of mixins and multiple inheritance which is probably not understood by anyone without checking and re-checking the documentation, the code, or the excellent &lt;a href="https://ccbv.co.uk/"&gt;Classy Class-Based Views&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly not by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my ideal world, generic views would be composed of small reusable and composable functions which wuld cover 80% of use cases with 20% of the code. And if not, you could copy the whole code of the view, change or introduce a line or two and leave it at that. And since the functions do one thing (but do that well) you can immediately see what they are doing and why. You&amp;rsquo;d avoid the Hollywood Principle (Don&amp;rsquo;t call us, we&amp;rsquo;ll call you) in your code. Sure, your view is called by Django but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to introduce more and more layers of indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is full of advice that you should prefer composition over inheritance. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to outline what generic views could look like if they followed the composition paradigm. Note that the goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to gain points by showing that the resulting code is shorter. One important goal is maintainability by being easier to understand. Another important goal is showing a better path from a beginner&amp;rsquo;s use of views to an experts understanding of everything underneath it by bridging the gap using more powerful building blocks which don&amp;rsquo;t leave all the minutiae to you if the defaults don&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some repetition caused by copy pasting is fine. Not all identical three lines of code are the same. The &lt;a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor"&gt;Three Strikes And You Refactor&lt;/a&gt; rule&lt;sup id="fnref:wet"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wet"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; leads to better and more maintainable code than following an extreme interpretation of the DRY (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ListView and DetailView&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to profit from Django&amp;rsquo;s shortcuts module and also from &lt;a href="https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/shortcuts.html"&gt;feincms3&amp;rsquo;s shortcuts module&lt;/a&gt; which offers functions for rendering pages for single objects or lists of objects. The &lt;code&gt;render_list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;render_detail&lt;/code&gt; functions implement the same way of determining the template paths as the generic views use (for example &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;app_name&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;model_name&amp;gt;_detail.html&lt;/code&gt;) and the same way of naming context variables (&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;model_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for the object, &lt;code&gt;object_list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;model_name&amp;gt;_list&lt;/code&gt; for the list) as well as pagination but nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a possible minimal implementation of a list and detail object generic view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# _get_queryset runs ._default_manager.all() on models and returns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# everything else as-is. It&amp;#39;s the secret sauce which allows using models,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# managers or querysets with get_object_or_404 and friends.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.shortcuts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_queryset&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;feincms3.shortcuts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;object_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;paginate_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;paginate_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paginate_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;object_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to change the way a single object is retrieved? You could do that easily but not by adding configuration-adjacent values in your URLconf but rather by adding a view yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;article_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;articles/&amp;lt;year:int&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;slug:slug&amp;gt;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;article_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that was much harder than a hypothetical alternative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;articles/&amp;lt;year:int&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;slug:slug&amp;gt;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;model&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;object_kwargs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;year&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And think about the internal implementation of the &lt;code&gt;object_detail&lt;/code&gt; view. Viewed one additional feature at a time it may be fine but when adding up everything it would probably be quite gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional benefit is that it shows beginners the way to intermediate skills &amp;ndash; writing views isn&amp;rsquo;t hard, and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the official way of overriding &lt;code&gt;DetailView.get_object()&lt;/code&gt; (I think!) doesn&amp;rsquo;t look that good compared to the &lt;code&gt;def article_detail()&lt;/code&gt; view above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArticleDetailView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DetailView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;year&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;code&gt;get_object()&lt;/code&gt; has an optional queryset argument? I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t. It seems to be used by the date-based generic views but they also have their own &lt;code&gt;get_object()&lt;/code&gt; implementation so who knows, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detail view with additional behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;article_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;POST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CommentForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseRedirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.#comments&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;comment_form&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A counterexample would be to move the endpoint which accepts a comment POST
request somewhere else. But then you&amp;rsquo;d also have to keep the different
&lt;code&gt;CommentForm&lt;/code&gt; instantiations in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also override &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt; to add the comment form to the
context and override &lt;code&gt;post()&lt;/code&gt; to instantiate check the form&amp;rsquo;s validity. But
then you&amp;rsquo;d have to make sure that an eventual invalid form is handled correctly
by &lt;code&gt;get_context_data()&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard but it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t as
straightforward as the example above either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The custom view is the most obvious way of keeping the form instantiation in
one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Form views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic create and update views could look something like this, again reusing the shortcuts mentioned above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;save_and_redirect_to_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_form_instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Provide at least one of model and form_class&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modelform_factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;POST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;object_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_and_redirect_to_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form_instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;form&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name_suffix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;_form&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;object_update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;slug&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_and_redirect_to_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_object_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_form_instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;form&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template_name_suffix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;_form&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to redirect to a different URL and maybe emit a success message? Easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;article_form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Successfully updated the article.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;articles:list&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;slug:slug&amp;gt;/update/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;object_update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;model&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;form_valid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;article_form_valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, these generic views wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow overriding the case when a form was invalid. But, I&amp;rsquo;d assume that displaying the form with error messages is the right thing to do in 90% of the cases. And if not, write your own specific or generic view? After all, with the mentioned tools it won&amp;rsquo;t take up more than a few lines of straightforward code. (If the code was tricky it would be different. But views shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be tricky.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more &lt;code&gt;form_valid&lt;/code&gt; handlers should be mostly painless. A few examples inspired by &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/class-based-views/generic-editing/"&gt;Django&amp;rsquo;s generic editing documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;save_and_redirect_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;send_mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;send_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseRedirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/thanks/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;set_author_and_save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created_by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also couple the form a bit to the request and do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;def process_form(request, form):
    return form.process(request)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, forms probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t know much about requests. But then, Django is a framework for perfectionists &lt;em&gt;with deadlines&lt;/em&gt; and sometimes practicality beats purity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Date-based generic views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would want to offer a few analyzers which allow easily returning a
data structure suitable for rendering links for yearly, monthly, weekly or even
daily (who writes that much?) archives. The &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/querysets/#dates"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.dates()&lt;/code&gt; queryset
method&lt;/a&gt;
method should be a big help there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive views themselves are straightforward adaptations of the
&lt;code&gt;object_list&lt;/code&gt; view above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may feel like leaving out the actually hard part but I&amp;rsquo;d have to be
convinced that this is actually a hard problem and not just a problem of making
basically arbitrary choices which people then adapt to and then think that this
is the way things should be since it&amp;rsquo;s the way things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some points this post could have made or tried to make are made much better by
Luke Plant in the guide &lt;a href="https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/"&gt;Django Views - The Right
Way&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t
generally think that class-based views never make sense. I also don&amp;rsquo;t think
that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use the available tools. I just think that I, myself,
don&amp;rsquo;t want to use them, and I also think that I&amp;rsquo;m still happier with &lt;code&gt;lambda
request: HttpResponseRedirect(...)&lt;/code&gt; than with
&lt;code&gt;generic.RedirectView.as_view(url=...)&lt;/code&gt;. The point isn&amp;rsquo;t to compare the
character count. The point is: Does the &lt;code&gt;RedirectView&lt;/code&gt; cause a permanent or a
temporary redirect? I had to look it up for a long time, and then it changed.
The former is completely obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that people have strong opinions. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in all of them. I&amp;rsquo;m
mostly interested in design critiques and arguments regarding the beginner to
intermediate skills argument. It&amp;rsquo;s fine if CBVs work fine for you, and there&amp;rsquo;s
no need to feel challenged by this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Async Django&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Django Channels&lt;/a&gt; successfully in a few projects from 2017 to 2019. A few months back I have worked with &lt;a href="https://www.starlette.io/"&gt;Starlette&lt;/a&gt;. And now I have finally started digging into using Django itself with an ASGI server, and not just for one or two views but also including the middleware stack etc since I also need authentication, not just an endpoint forwarding requests to a remote server. I have looked at &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian"&gt;Granian&lt;/a&gt;, an RSGI/ASGI server written in Rust. But for now I am using &lt;a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/"&gt;uvicorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django truly has come a long way but there&amp;rsquo;s much left to do. Django 5.0 is looking great already, but 4.2 misses many pieces still. I am really really glad Django wants to stay backwards compatible but I wish I could wave a magic wand and upgrade everything to async. Adding &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; prefixes everywhere for the async version is certainly a good compromise and probably the way to go but it&amp;rsquo;s just not that nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with making &lt;a href="https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/"&gt;feincms3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s applications middleware async compatible because I want the full middleware stack to be async. The code is already released but undocumented and not even mentioned in the changelog. So, feel free to play around with it but it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be stable or supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3/"&gt;feincms3 4.1&lt;/a&gt;: Switched to hatchling and ruff. Updated the feincms3-sites docs. Some async updates mentioned above. A Django 4.2 admin CSS update for the inline CKEditor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-forms/"&gt;feincms3-forms 0.4&lt;/a&gt;: Switched to hatchling and ruff. Started defining default icons for the form fields &lt;a href="https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/"&gt;content editor&lt;/a&gt; plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-ckeditor/"&gt;django-ckeditor 6.7&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m still maintaining the CKEditor 4 integration for Django even though CKEditor 4 itself isn&amp;rsquo;t supported anymore. Minor updates to the editor itself and Pillow compatibility updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.3.2&lt;/a&gt;: The cookie banner doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate an empty &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="f3cc"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element anymore if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to add inside (e.g. if the user only accepted necessary cookies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How ruff changed my Python programming habits</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/how-ruff-changed-my-python-programming-habits/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/how-ruff-changed-my-python-programming-habits/</id><published>2023-07-26T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-26T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;How ruff changed my Python programming habits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t just a faster replacement for flake8, isort
and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With other Python-based formatters and linters there&amp;rsquo;s always a trade off
between development speed (waiting on &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; is very boring) and
strictness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ruff is so fast that enabling additional rules is practically free in terms of
speed; the only question is if those rules lead to better, or maybe just to
more correct and consistent code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been using &lt;a href="https://pre-commit.com/"&gt;pre-commit&lt;/a&gt;, and even longer
flake8, black, isort. I have written a piece about &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/flake8-and-value-standards/"&gt;flake8 and the value of
standards&lt;/a&gt; almost 9 years
ago and have continued moving in the mentioned direction ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I have enabled a wide variety of rules. I&amp;rsquo;m not sold on all of them
(looking at you, pylint) and I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not of the opinion that rules which
I&amp;rsquo;m not using currently are worthless. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know most of these rules
before starting to use ruff, and ruff making them easy and painless to use
(without a measureable performance penalty) has certainly lead to me annoying
my coworkers with a growing set of enabled rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current ruleset and some justifications for it follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pyflakes, pycodestyle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No justification necessary, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;mccabe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the cyclomatic complexity checker, but I have relaxed it a bit. I find it very useful to avoid complex code, but some code is totally straightforward (e.g. building a queryset from a wide variety of query parameters) but still has many &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements. I&amp;rsquo;d rather allow more complexity instead of sprinkling the code with &lt;code&gt;# noqa&lt;/code&gt; statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;isort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorted imports are great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pep8-naming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly great except when it flags Django&amp;rsquo;s migration files. The filenames
always start with numbers and that&amp;rsquo;s obviously not a valid Python module name,
but it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pyupgrade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pyupgrade is totally awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake-2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding non future-proof uses of &lt;code&gt;sys.version&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sys.version_info&lt;/code&gt; is a good idea, no questions about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-boolean-trap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes annoying, mostly useful. I don&amp;rsquo;t like that the plugin flags e.g. &lt;code&gt;with_tree_fields(True)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;with_tree_fields(False)&lt;/code&gt; because I don&amp;rsquo;t think this could be possibly misread. But, apart from these edge cases it really is a good idea, especially since keyword-only arguments exist and those aren&amp;rsquo;t flagged by this rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-bugbear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly useful. I have disabled the &lt;code&gt;zip()&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;strict=&lt;/code&gt; warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-comprehensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checks for unnecessary conversions between generators and lists, sets, tuples or dicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually like consistency. I also like flagging &lt;code&gt;fields = "__all__"&lt;/code&gt;, but this check shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trigger in admin &lt;code&gt;ModelForm&lt;/code&gt; classes, really. I probably have to add another entry to &lt;code&gt;[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]&lt;/code&gt; for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-pie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a random assortment of rules. I like the &lt;code&gt;no-unnecessary-pass&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;no-pointless-statements&lt;/code&gt; rules, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-simplify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice simplifications. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if ternary opeartors are always a plus, especially since they hide the branching from &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/coverage/"&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;flake8-gettext&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enormously useful and important. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times I have encountered broken code like &lt;code&gt;gettext("Hello {name}".format(name=name))&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;gettext("Hello {name}").format(name=name)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pygrep-hooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoids &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt;. Avoids blanket &lt;code&gt;# noqa&lt;/code&gt; rules (always be specific!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pylint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using all pylint rules for some time. The pylint refactoring rules (&lt;code&gt;PLR&lt;/code&gt;) did prove to be very annoying so I have reverted to only enabling errors and warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main offenders were PLR0913 (too many arguments) and PLR2004 (magic value comparison). The former would be fine if it would count keyword-only arguments differently; it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a good idea to avoid too many positional parameters, I don&amp;rsquo;t think keyword-only parameters are that bad. The latter is bad because often the magic value is really obvious. If you&amp;rsquo;re writing code for the web you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to use constants for the &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; status codes; one can assume that they are well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RUF100&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruff is able to automatically remove &lt;code&gt;# noqa&lt;/code&gt; statements which don&amp;rsquo;t actually silence any warnings. That&amp;rsquo;s a great feature to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Line length&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, let&amp;rsquo;s go there. I still don&amp;rsquo;t use longer lines than +/- 80 characters, but
I have disabled all line length warnings these days. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be warned
because I didn&amp;rsquo;t break a string across lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flake8-builtins: Too many boring warnings. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even want to know that
  &lt;code&gt;copyright&lt;/code&gt; is a Python builtin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flake8-logging-format: Not generally helpful. Avoiding different exception strings so that e.g. &lt;a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt; can group exceptions more easily is a good idea, but the rule generated so many false positives as to be not useful anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words (for now)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope that Black is integrated into ruff one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I hope that ESLint and prettier will be replaced by a faster tool. I have my eyes on a few alternatives, but they are not there yet for my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 29)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-29/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-29/</id><published>2023-07-21T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-21T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mainly done work in private projects this week. Not much to talk about.
Except for the ZIP file &lt;code&gt;content-type&lt;/code&gt; bug which was interesting enough to
justify &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/serving-zip-files-using-django/"&gt;its own blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-cabinet/"&gt;django-cabinet 0.13&lt;/a&gt;: I converted
  the package to use ruff, hatchling; started running CI tests using Python
  3.11. The internals of the Django admin&amp;rsquo;s filters have changed to allow
  multi-valued filters, this has required some changes to the implementation of
  the folder filter. I opted to using a relatively ugly &lt;code&gt;django.VERSION&lt;/code&gt;
  hack; but that&amp;rsquo;s not too bad since such branches will be automatically
  removed by the awesome
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade"&gt;django-upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. I would have
  tried finding other ways in the past but now that old compatibility code can
  be removed by a single run of &lt;code&gt;django-upgrade&lt;/code&gt; (respectively
  &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;) there really is no point to doing it in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Serving ZIP files using Django</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/serving-zip-files-using-django/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/serving-zip-files-using-django/</id><published>2023-07-18T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-18T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Serving ZIP files using Django&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have generated ZIP files on the fly and served them using Django for a time.
Serving ZIP files worked well until it didn&amp;rsquo;t and browsing StackOverflow etc.
didn&amp;rsquo;t produce clear answers either. The development server worked fine, but
gunicorn/nginx didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I had to change &lt;code&gt;content_type="application/zip"&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;content_type="application/x-zip-compressed"&lt;/code&gt;. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what changed
and I have only theories why that&amp;rsquo;s necessary, but maybe it helps someone else.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s better to be dumber about it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 28)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-28/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-28/</id><published>2023-07-12T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-07-12T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 28)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/"&gt;html-sanitizer 2.2&lt;/a&gt;: Made the
  sanitizer&amp;rsquo;s configuration initialization more strict. Strings cannot be used
  anymore in places where the sanitizer expects a set (resp. any iterable).
  It&amp;rsquo;s useful that strings are iterable in Python and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to change
  that, but the fact that &lt;code&gt;("class")&lt;/code&gt; is a string and not a tuple makes me sad.
  The fact that tuples are created by &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and not by &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; will always trip up
  people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-language-sites/"&gt;feincms3-language-sites
  0.1&lt;/a&gt;: The version number
  is wrong but whatever. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly happy with the state of things. The big
  change in 0.1 is that &lt;code&gt;Page.get_absolute_url&lt;/code&gt; no longer generates
  protocol-relative URLs. Depending on the value of &lt;code&gt;SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; it
  automatically prepends either &lt;code&gt;http:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-authlib/"&gt;django-authlib 0.15&lt;/a&gt;:
  django-authlib&amp;rsquo;s admin Single Sign On module now supports a hook to
  automatically create staff users when a matching user doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist already.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to use this functionality myself and I have recommended people
  to implement the functionality themselves using the tools in django-authlib
  if they need it, but the change was so small and well-contained that adding
  it to the core made sense to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipx inject&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that &lt;a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/"&gt;pipx&lt;/a&gt; seems to remember injected
packages even across &lt;code&gt;pipx reinstall&lt;/code&gt; invocations. Not too surprising now that
we know it, but we certainly spent some time scratching our heads. &lt;code&gt;pipx
uninject&lt;/code&gt; was the thing we needed to stop pipx from installing an old version
of a dependency instead of the one being specified in &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;hatchling and data files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very confused by the way &lt;a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/"&gt;hatchling&lt;/a&gt; sometimes
includes data files and sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I had to add &lt;code&gt;[tool.hatch.build]
include=["authlib/"]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/django-authlib/commit/67d4673e4039eac277b5d2557c0736c1f01442ac"&gt;django-authlib&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;
file&lt;/a&gt;
to make it include HTML files from subpackages. Maybe the subpackages are the
reason, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Payment providers that must not be named&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent hours and hours battling with the badly documented, incomplete,
inconsistent and confusing API of a (not that well known) payment provider
based in Switzerland. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that this still happens years and years
after Stripe started offering a really well thought out and documented API
geared towards programmers. It&amp;rsquo;s really sad because when the same structure is
named with differing naming conventions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;snake_case&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;camelCase&lt;/code&gt;) in
different parts of the API you just know that somebody spent too much time

&lt;p&gt;I released updates to a few of my packages; I have continued converting packages to &lt;a href="https://hatch.pypa.io"&gt;hatchling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt; while doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New releases in the last two weeks include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tree-queries/"&gt;django-tree-queries 0.15&lt;/a&gt;: Added a new function, &lt;code&gt;.without_tree_fields()&lt;/code&gt; to the queryset which can be used to avoid the &lt;code&gt;.with_tree_fields(False)&lt;/code&gt; boolean trap warning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.3.1&lt;/a&gt;: This small update allows replacing the feincms3 &lt;a href="https://noembed.com"&gt;noembed.com&lt;/a&gt; oEmbed code using other libraries such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/coleifer/micawber/"&gt;micawber&lt;/a&gt; which support a wider range of URLs while still gating the embed behind users&amp;rsquo; explicit consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-downloads/"&gt;feincms3-downloads 0.5.3&lt;/a&gt;: Updated translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-ckeditor/"&gt;django-ckeditor 6.6.1&lt;/a&gt;: Updated the bundled CKEditor 4 and merged a pull request adding better integration with Django admin&amp;rsquo;s dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/"&gt;django-js-asset 2.1&lt;/a&gt;: Just basic maintainability and packaging updates. The &lt;code&gt;JS()&lt;/code&gt; implementation itself is untouched since February 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/"&gt;html-sanitizer 2.0&lt;/a&gt;: Not really a backwards incompatible change (at least not according to the tests); I just wanted to avoid &lt;code&gt;1.10&lt;/code&gt; and go directly to &lt;code&gt;2.0&lt;/code&gt; this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using GitHub project boards more and more. It definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t the most versatile way of managing projects but it sort-of hits the sweet spot for us. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly happy with it, and it seems to me that applying &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power"&gt;the rule of least power&lt;/a&gt; to project management software may not be such a bad idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built-in workflows are a bit boring and limited; especially the fact that it seems impossible to automatically add issues to the project when using multiple repositories. Luckily, &lt;a href="https://github.com/actions/add-to-project"&gt;actions/add-to-project&lt;/a&gt; exists so that&amp;rsquo;s not really a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To cloud or not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a long discussion with a colleague about containerization, Kubernetes, self-hosting, etc. etc. and I still don&amp;rsquo;t know where I stand. I can honestly say that the old way of hosting (ca. 2010) still works fine. I worry about the deterioriation of service quality we&amp;rsquo;re seeing and sometimes I really would like to have root to apply quick fixes where now I have to jump to hoops just to get what I already know I need. Annoying. But migrations are annoying as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduled publishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I augmented the script generating this website with scheduled publishing support while again reducing the number of lines in the file. The code is still formatted using black and ruff, while only ignoring line-length errors (I do this everywhere now to avoid breaking up long strings, not to put much code onto single lines) and allowing named lambdas. The weeknotes from two weeks ago where published by GitHub actions&amp;rsquo; cron scheduling support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I like programming more than writing (even though I like writing)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that writing is the first thing I start skipping when I have to
prioritize. Programming, biking, gardening come first. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, really. But
I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit sad that I do not manage to at least put out a short weekly
weeknotes entry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>FeinCMS is a dead end (but feincms3 is not)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/feincms-is-a-dead-end-but-feincms3-is-not/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/feincms-is-a-dead-end-but-feincms3-is-not/</id><published>2023-06-19T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-06-19T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;FeinCMS is a dead end (but feincms3 is not)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t encourage people to start new sites with FeinCMS. Five years ago I wrote that &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/the-future-of-feincms/"&gt;FeinCMS is used in a few flagship projects which we’re still actively developing, which means that FeinCMS won’t be going away for years to come.&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s still true but less and less so. We&amp;rsquo;re actively moving away from FeinCMS where we can, mostly towards feincms3 and django-content-editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/the-other-future-of-feincms-django-content-editor-and-feincms3/"&gt;FeinCMS lives on in django-content-editor and feincms3&lt;/a&gt;; not only in spirit but also in (code) history, since django-content-editor contains the whole history of FeinCMS up to and including the beginning of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of FeinCMS is too expensive to clean up without breaking backwards compatibility. I still wish I had pursued an incremental way back then which would have allowed us to evolve old projects to the current best way of doing things (tm), but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen and I&amp;rsquo;m not shedding too many tears about that since I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with where we&amp;rsquo;re at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That basically means that I won&amp;rsquo;t put any effort into &lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/bringing-feincms-and-django-content-editorfeincms3-closer-together/"&gt;bringing FeinCMS and django-content-editor closer together&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent much time on that anyway but now my mind is made up that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be time well spent. That being said, some of the items mentioned in the blog post linked above are available in django-content-editor now.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 24)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-24/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-24/</id><published>2023-06-16T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-06-16T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 24)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life happened and I missed a month of weeknotes. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-debug-toolbar 4.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have released &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/"&gt;django-debug-toolbar
4.1&lt;/a&gt;. Another cycle where I
mostly contributed reviews and not much else. Feels great :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going all in on hatch and hatchling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know hatch because django-debug-toolbar was converted to it. I was
confused as probably anyone else with the new state of packaging in Python
world. After listening to a few Podcasts (for example &lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/408/hatch-a-modern-python-workflow"&gt;Hatch: A Modern Python
Workflow&lt;/a&gt;)
I did bite the bullet and started converting projects to hatch as mentioned
&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-13-and-14/"&gt;some time ago&lt;/a&gt;. I have
converted a few other projects in the meantime because the development
experience is nicer. Not much, but enough to make it worthwile.
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-sites/"&gt;feincms3-sites&lt;/a&gt; is the latest
package I converted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CKEditor 5&amp;rsquo;s new license and django-ckeditor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure is on to maybe switch away from CKEditor 4 since it probably will not be supported after &lt;a href="https://support.ckeditor.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005281629-How-long-will-CKEditor-4-be-supported-"&gt;June 2023&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s totally understandable that the CKEditor 5 license isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as before, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that means for the Django integration &lt;a href="https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/issues/482"&gt;django-ckeditor&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining since a few years. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like the new capabilities of CKEditor all that much and don&amp;rsquo;t intend to use them; maybe it would be better to use a build of &lt;a href=""&gt;ProseMirror&lt;/a&gt; in the CMS since &lt;a href="https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#about-rich-text-editors"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re intentionally only using a very small subset of the features most rich text editors offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mountain biking.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mountain bike is repaired, I&amp;rsquo;m back on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>CSS variables and immutability</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/css-variables-and-immutability/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/css-variables-and-immutability/</id><published>2023-06-14T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-06-14T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Using CSS variables&lt;sup id="fnref:variables"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:variables"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to ship customizable CSS in Django apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with &lt;a href="https://sass-lang.com/"&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt; for a long time but
have been moving towards writing CSS with a few &lt;a href="https://postcss.org/"&gt;PostCSS&lt;/a&gt;
goodies in the last years. At first, I just replaced the &lt;code&gt;$...&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;var(--...)&lt;/code&gt; and didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it. The realization that CSS variables
can be more than that came later. Edit basic values directly in the browser and
immediately see the results! Change CSS depending on media queries or the
cascade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that power came back the wish to not just ship backend and HTML code
in Django apps I (help) maintain but also reusable CSS, with a few overrideable
CSS variables for basic changes to the visual style. Loading &lt;code&gt;.scss&lt;/code&gt; files from
somewhere inside &lt;code&gt;venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/&amp;lt;package&amp;gt;/styles/&lt;/code&gt; would of
course have been possible, but very obscure. Also, not everyone puts their
virtualenv at &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; instructions for those packages would
quickly have become unwieldy. CSS variables paved the way for shipping CSS as a
Django static file while still allowing customizability by leveraging the
functionality of the browser itself instead of the frontend build toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns for overrideable values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pattern for defining defaults for CSS variables is to always define the
fallback (the example is intentionally bad but inspired by real world
experiences when developing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/feinheit/feincms3-cookiecontrol"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Less repetition (but trouble awaits)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;--box-background&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t set the &lt;code&gt;var()&lt;/code&gt; function falls back to the second
argument, &lt;code&gt;#222&lt;/code&gt;. Repeating this value over and over gets annoying quickly, so
you define a few defaults on the &lt;code&gt;:root&lt;/code&gt; element and use those variables in the
code, without specifying the default again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can now override the default background color using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course now you&amp;rsquo;re back at the mercy of CSS loading order. If the app&amp;rsquo;s CSS
is loaded first, everything works. If not, your custom value is immediately
overwritten. You could avoid this by overwriting the default lower in the cascade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, everything works again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the box also contains a button which uses a different background but the
same foreground, so of course we add more variables in the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-button-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-button-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens now when overwriting the &lt;code&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/code&gt; variable just for the
&lt;code&gt;.box&lt;/code&gt; element?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not sure? I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t and am not. But what I remember happening
was that the overridden foreground color was just applied to the text and not
to the button itself. I was confused (it seems clearer in hindsight&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A better way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If values are supposed to be overridden and only used inside components, a
better way is to define local CSS for components by following a convention
(underscore prefix for local/private variables):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Defined on .box, not :root */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--_background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--_foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--_button-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-button-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--_button-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--box-button-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you only use the prefixed versions inside the component:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box__button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;-background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;-foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--box-*&lt;/code&gt; variables are undefined by default; the only time when they are
set is when the user of the package wants to override those values. If you only
overide the box foreground the button also inherits the new foreground color.
And while there would certainly be a way to achieve the same thing with the old
way above it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not as simple to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s simple to explain is &lt;strong&gt;immutability&lt;/strong&gt;. The CSS variables
which are overrideable by the user are only ever read by the package, never
written to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:variables"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom properties would probably be the more correct naming, but CSS variables is nicer to say.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:variables" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Unlearning SCSS to use CSS variables effectively</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/unlearning-scss-to-use-css-variables-effectively/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/unlearning-scss-to-use-css-variables-effectively/</id><published>2023-05-31T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-05-31T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Unlearning SCSS to use CSS variables effectively&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCSS variables are a way to stop repeating the same values over and over. They
are very useful already, especially when used together with some of the more
interesting SCSS functions such as &lt;code&gt;brighten()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;darken()&lt;/code&gt; etc. CSS doesn&amp;rsquo;t
really have ways to do the same yet. &lt;code&gt;hsl(var(...)...)&lt;/code&gt; only gets you so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS variables are another beast. You can use them the same way by replacing &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;
with &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; but if you do this you&amp;rsquo;re missing out big time on the features which
actually make CSS variables great: The cascade and the ability to update them
in response to media queries, interactions or other events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I&amp;rsquo;m using CSS variables is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define good defaults on the &lt;code&gt;:root&lt;/code&gt; selector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change those defaults in response to media queries, e.g. for large screens
  when writing mobile first CSS &amp;ndash; as you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Override defaults in some contexts, e.g. in an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or some other
  fitting component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you wanted different spacings between components depending on the
breakpoint. You could go the fully fluid route with &lt;code&gt;clamp()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt;
and viewport-relative units. It&amp;rsquo;s simpler to keep the complexity lower and use
breakpoints, certainly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;800px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use &lt;code&gt;var(--space)&lt;/code&gt; everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalent SCSS would probably look something like this, with a fitting
&lt;code&gt;breakpoint()&lt;/code&gt; mixin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$space-sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$space-md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;space-sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;breakpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;space-md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t look too bad until you have to repeat the breakpoint in all your
components. That&amp;rsquo;s when SCSS gets boring while CSS is staying awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upping your game.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also use
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-nesting-experimental"&gt;postcss-nesting&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-custom-media"&gt;postcss-custom-media&lt;/a&gt;
and write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="chl"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;custom-media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--media-md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;800px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;(--media-md)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;--space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nesting is definitely a two-edged sword though. CSS methodologies such as BEM
(Block Element Modifier) should generally fix the need to use nesting at all.
Nesting leads to overspecific CSS, and also to an enormous amount of generated
CSS which is also brittle and basically impossible to refactor (&amp;ldquo;write-only
CSS&amp;rdquo;). But, in some contexts it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I do like the fact that
indentation has a specific meaning if used like that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 18 and 19)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-18-and-19/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-18-and-19/</id><published>2023-05-12T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-05-12T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 18 and 19)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much programming this week :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/"&gt;Still occupying myself with oEmbed.&lt;/a&gt; I have been looking at a few libraries and have rediscovered &lt;a href="https://github.com/coleifer/micawber/"&gt;micawber&lt;/a&gt; which probably does everything I need. Yay, another reinvented wheel avoided. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it yet but I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that replacing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3/blob/main/feincms3/plugins/external.py"&gt;oEmbed functionality in feincms3&amp;rsquo;s external plugin&lt;/a&gt; with micawber would be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vacation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacation last week. Was nice. We went for a few hikes. I have learned that I&amp;rsquo;m
not totally free from giddiness anymore. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Weeknotes (2023 week 17)</title><link href="https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/" rel="alternate" /><id>https://406.ch/writing/weeknotes-2023-week-17/</id><published>2023-04-28T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2023-04-28T12:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weeknotes (2023 week 17)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Birthday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year achieved. Feels the same as last year. I&amp;rsquo;m glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have released &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/"&gt;feincms3-cookiecontrol
1.3&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly cleanups since
1.2, but also a new translation (already announced here). The script size has
been reduced from 4519 bytes to 4228 bytes (-6.5%) while keeping all features
intact. The reduction is totally meaningless but it was fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;oEmbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been digging into the oEmbed spec a bit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that a
central list of &lt;a href="https://oembed.com/providers.json"&gt;providers&lt;/a&gt; exists.
&lt;a href="https://noembed.com/"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; still works great to embed many different types
of content but I worry more and more about its maintenance state.
Reimplementing the interesting parts shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, but maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to do this myself. &lt;a href="https://github.com/attakei-lab/oEmbedPy/"&gt;oEmbedPy&lt;/a&gt;
looks nice, I hope I get a chance to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
