Writing products and the attention span</h1><p>We started developing software with grandiose up front plans with durations of several months. We defined sprints, each with several goals and each going on for several weeks.<p>We failed.<p>Does this surprise anyone?<p>I consider myself to have a good attention span. I can concentrate on a single problem for hours (if I’m not interrupted externally, anyway) and not only forget the time but also make good advances in a project.<p>However, I cannot focus on a single task for weeks and weeks. Days are maybe possible. Building a product requires much more time than that. This means that the development should be divided up onto a multitude of mini-sprints, each having an easily understandable motto which focusses and thereby motivates everyone involved.<p>Keep the implementation time of the minimum lovable product below two months, or else you’ll most probably set yourself up for failure.</div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Prototyping.
