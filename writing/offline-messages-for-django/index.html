Its API surface is small, it’s fast and it does what it does really well.<p>However, it sometimes happens that you would want to send messages to users outside the request-response cycle, for example from a background process or even from a <code>post_save</code> signal handler.<p>Adding a full-blown notifications-and-messages-system is of course possible. Sending a one-off message to the user would be sufficient though, but there is no way to do this with Django’s messages framework.<p>There are a few packages around solving this particular problem. Almost all of them solve this by saving undelivered messages in the database. My solution, <a href=https://django-user-messages.readthedocs.io/>django-user-messages</a> follows the same approach, but contrary to many others it does not reimplement the message storage nor replace any other functionality of <code>django.contrib.messages</code>. It only adds a few additional utilities for adding messages (e.g. <code>user_messages.api.info(...)</code> instead of <code>messages.info(...)</code>) and a context processor which concatenates Django’s messages with those provided by django-user-messages.<p>Instead of passing the request to <code>messages.info(...)</code> you would pass a user instance, or even only a user ID to <code>api.info(...)</code>.<p>Easy enough, and works well. Despite the 0.5 version number the package has been stable and essentially unchanged since July 2017 (except for the addition of Python 2 support). So I wont say to get it while it’s hot, because it’s not – instead, it is boring, stable and reliable, the way I like my <a href=https://406.ch/writing/low-maintenance-software/>low maintenance software</a>.<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/matthiask/django-user-messages/>django-user-messages on Github</a><li><a href=https://django-user-messages.readthedocs.io/>Documentation on readthedocs.io</a></ul></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Offline messages for Django">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2018-04-18 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
