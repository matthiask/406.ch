It feels more stressful than at other times, and this mostly has to do with particular projects. I hope I’ll be able to move on soon.<h2>blacknoise</h2><p>I have released <a href=https://pypi.org/project/blacknoise/>blacknoise 1.0</a>. It’s an ASGI app for static file serving inspired by <a href=https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise/>whitenoise</a>.<p>The 1.0 version number is only a big step in versioning terms, not much has happened with the code. It’s a tiny little well working piece of software which has been running in production for some time without any hickups. The biggest recent change is that I have parallelized the gzip and brotli compression step; this makes building images using whitenoise more painful because there the wait is really really long sometimes. <a href=https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise/pull/484>A pull request fixing this exists</a>, but it hasn’t moved forwards in months.<p>I have written a longer post about it earlier this year <a href=https://406.ch/writing/blacknoise-asgi-app-for-static-file-serving/>here</a>.<h2>Releases</h2><ul><li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-cookiecontrol/>feincms3-cookiecontrol 1.5</a>: Code golfing. Added backwards compatibility with old Django versions so that I can use it for old projects. Also includes optional support for Google consent management.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django_fast_export/>django-fast-export 0.1.1</a>: This is basically a repackaging of the streaming CSV view from Django’s documentation as a reusable class. I have switched to using an iterator so that I can export even larger datasets.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-json-schema-editor/>django-json-schema-editor 0.0.18</a>: Still alpha versioned but used in production in various projects. I should really release an 1.0 version, but there are no integration tests at all. Mainly visual tweaks in this update.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/django-content-editor/>django-content-editor 6.5</a>: Better handling of templates and regions when a particular editor instance only shows a subset of configured templates. Disallowed adding plugins when in an unknown region. It’s funny how many edge cases exist in software as old as this.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/blacknoise/>blacknoise 1.0</a>: See above.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/>html-sanitizer 2.4.4</a>: Fixed edge cases with whitespace handling when merging elements.<li><a href=https://pypi.org/project/feincms3-data/>feincms3-data 0.6.1</a>: Allowed <code>./manage.py f3loaddata -</code> to load JSON data from stdin.</ul></div></div></main><footer><div class=wrappy><p><small> I like feedback! <a href="mailto:mk@406.ch?subject=Weeknotes (2024 week 21)">Send me an email.</a> <br> <a rel="noopener noreferrer"href=https://ko-fi.com/matthiask target=_blank>☕ Buy me a coffee?</a> <br> Published on 2024-05-22 in <a href=/writing/category-django/>Django</a>, <a href=/writing/category-programming/>Programming</a>, <a href=/writing/category-weeknotes/>Weeknotes</a> </small></p><script async crossorigin issue-term=pathname repo=matthiask/406-comments src=https://utteranc.es/client.js theme=github-light></script></div></footer>
