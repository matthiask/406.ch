# django-cabinet &ndash; A media library for Django

django-cabinet is a media library for Django implemented while trying to write as little code as possible to keep maintenance at a minimum. At the time of writing the projects consists of less than 1000 lines of code (excluding tests), but still offers hierarchical folders, downloads, images with primary point of interest (courtesy of django-imagefield) and drag-drop uploading of files directly into the folder view.

You'll find more details and screenshots at [Github](https://github.com/matthiask/django-cabinet) and [Read the Docs](https://django-cabinet.readthedocs.io/).

(Updated on 2018-04-09 to mention django-imagefield instead of django-versatileimagefield.)
