Even complicated sites can be ported with ease to Python 3 now. Spreadsheet and PDF exports work fine with [openpyxl](https://pythonhosted.org/openpyxl/) and [ReportLab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab).

There's no excuse for not switching if your hosting environment supports it. Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (or equivalent distributions) is now offered by Digital Ocean, Nine and other providers, and it comes with [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/).
