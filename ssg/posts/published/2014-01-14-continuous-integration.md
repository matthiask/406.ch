How did I ever manage to release working packages without continuous integration?

More often than not I didn't. The first minor releases were always buggy, you had to wait until the first or second patch level if you wanted a complete and working package.

Of course a contributing factor to this was the desolate state of Python packaging. The state of affairs is much better than back then, and more improvements are already underway.

The tool Iâ€™m using for almost all of my regularly updated Python / Django packages is [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

The FeinCMS page status page is an example demonstrating (a small part of) what Travis CI is capable of: [FeinCMS](https://travis-ci.org/feincms/feincms).
