# Weeknotes (2023 week 6)

## Rust

I made some progress learning Rust. I don't have to look up each character and function and am slowly getting a feel for the language, unwrapping and the borrow checker, so that's nice.

I don't have a use for it for now, but we'll see.

## feincms3-data and data cycles

I added support for loading data with cyclic dependencies to [feincms3-data](https://github.com/matthiask/feincms3-data). This is useful e.g. when having Django models where you have a `ForeignKey("self")` and you want to use feincms3-data to insert a new copy of some object and its dependencies.

## Editing trees in the Django administration interface

I'm back to one of my favorite (not) activities which is making tree-shaped data editable in the Django administration panel. [FeinCMS](https://github.com/feincms/feincms) and later [django-mptt](https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/) augments the changelist with some drag drop behavior. There's no undo functionality though so making errors is potentially really bad.

[feincms3](https://feincms3.readthedocs.io/) uses a separate page for moving nodes around.

Now I'm working on a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)-based project which also doesn't use drag drop but which also allows inserting nodes, not just moving nodes around. I doubt I can make it reusable enough to make it useful for feincms3 but we'll see.
