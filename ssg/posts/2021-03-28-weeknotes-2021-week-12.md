# Weeknotes (2021 week 12)

Not much open source work this week. The final thesis and presentation for the CAS in Interaction Design was due. I learned a lot but for now I'm just glad that it's over. I'm looking forward to relearning how to do "nothing" on weekends.

## FeinCMS 1.20

Some FeinCMS 1.x ItemEditor element attributes clashed with new IDs introduced in Django 3.1. The new version of FeinCMS fixes this.

## feincms3

Fixed a few problems in the new inline CKEditor widget for the Django admin. An oversight made it impossible to add CKEditor instances with different configurations. Luckily enough this only affected beta/preview releases :-)
