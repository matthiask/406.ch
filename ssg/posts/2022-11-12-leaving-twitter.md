# Leaving Twitter

I have been more or less regularly using Twitter since 2009. I enjoyed it, sometimes more, sometimes less.

I liked a lot that Twitter offered me a way to follow the thoughts and works of interesting people.

It surfaced ways of thinking and cultures which I probably wouldn't have learned about otherwise.

In the last few years and (of course) especially in the last few weeks things god worse very quickly. I don't want to be a part of the Twitter community anymore. I'm not sure if my use of Twitter helps or costs Twitter anything, but this doesn't really matter all that much.

What matters is that I have all that and more by using RSS and Mastodon. I've never stopped using RSS and I have found [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/) to be a good replacement for Google Reader and have been using it ever since (if I do not misremember things). The social network which I am happy to be a part of on Mastodon checks all boxes which my leaving Twitter left unchecked and even a few additional checkboxes I didn't even know. So, that's good for now.
